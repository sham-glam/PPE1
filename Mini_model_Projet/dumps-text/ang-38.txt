Type

   Serie

Country

   India
   Indian Street Food is a serie of stamps in SLOWLY. This can be
   purchased on the Stamp Store while you visit India.

Information

   Indian street food is sold by hawkers from portable market stalls.
   Street food is common all over India, and people from all economic
   classes eat on the roadside almost round the clock and it is sometimes
   felt that the taste of street food is better than restaurants.

   Many Indians like a small snack on the road in the evening. People
   across barriers of class, religion, gender and ethnicity are passionate
   about street food. Street food is relatively inexpensive as compared to
   restaurants and vendors tend to be clustered around crowded areas such
   as colleges and railway stations. Text from Wikipedia.
