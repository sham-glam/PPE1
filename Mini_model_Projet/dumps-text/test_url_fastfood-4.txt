   The fast food industry in India has evolved with the changing
   lifestyles of the young Indian population.^[citation needed] The
   variety of gastronomic preferences across the regions, hereditary or
   acquired, has brought about different modules across the country.

   Many of the traditional dishes have been adapted to suit the emerging
   fast food outlets. The basic adaptation is to decrease the processing
   and serving time. For example, the typical meal which called for being
   served by an ever-alert attendant is now offered as a Mini-Meal across
   the counter. In its traditional version, a plate or a banana leaf was
   first laid down on the floor or table. Several helpers then waited on
   the diner, doling out different dishes and refilling as they got over
   in the plate.

   In the fast-food version, a plate already arranged with a variety of
   cooked vegetables and curries along with a fixed quantity of rice and
   Indian flatbreads is handed out across the counter against a prepaid
   coupon. The curries and breads vary depending on the region and local
   preferences. The higher priced ones may add a sweet to the combination.
   Refills are generally not offered.

Styles[edit]

   It is common to serve different cuisines at different counters within
   the same premises. Presence of a large vegetarian population, who
   eschew non-vegetarian food, has given rise to outlets which exclusively
   serve vegetarian fast food. Also, different variety of food may be
   served depending on the times of the day. Beverages such coffee, tea,
   soft drinks and fruit juices may also be served in such outlets. Some
   outlets may additionally have specially designed counters for
   ice-cream, chaats etc.

   Popular formats of fast food business in India have the following
   features in common:
     * Wide opening on the roadside
     * Easy to maintain and durable décor
     * A cash counter where food coupons are sold
     * A food delivery counter which invariably is granite topped
     * Additional counters for Ice Creams, Chaats, Beverages etc.
     * A well fitted kitchen located so as to be visible to the customers
     * Tall tables, typically of stainless steel, where one can eat while
       standing
     * A drinking water fountain adorned with a water filter
     * Rust-proof and non-breakable crockery

   Most of the fast food outlets in India are stand alone establishment,
   few of them having more than one branch.

Darshini[edit]

   One of Bangalore's restaurateurs, Mr Prabhakar, opened an outlet called
   Upahara Darshini in mid-1980s. The novelty was that the food is cooked
   just behind the serving counter, visible to the customers, and one has
   to eat while standing by placing the food on tall tables. It is a
   self-service place where one has to buy a coupon before eating. It
   offered typical south Indian snacks at highly affordable prices
   resulting in an instant hit with the office goers as well as students.
   The size and the enclosed design of the eating space and consequent
   spilling over of the eaters onto the footpath during the busy hours
   indicates that he did not anticipate the level of success. This issue
   is addressed by those who copied the module by keeping the entire face
   of the outlet open the road. Many believe that this was a trendsetter
   and its format, described earlier, is even to this day replicated by
   other across south India. The popularity of this business module can be
   gauged from the fact that many restaurants which adopt this format have
   "Darshini" as suffix in their names.

Food courts[edit]

   Another concept of fast food that is becoming popular is that of Food
   Courts. Here also one has to purchase coupons and collect the food from
   one of the several counters. Each one of these counters serves specific
   variety of food and may be owned by different individuals or caterers.
   Food Courts are normally located on much bigger premises and may
   provide seating facility in addition to the stand and eat arrangement.
   Typically one entrepreneur owns or takes on lease the entire premises
   and promotes the place under one name. They then let out individual
   counters to different independent operators to offer different menu.
   Internal competition is avoided by not allowing more than one counter
   to offer similar food.

   Several international fast-food chains like Kentucky Fried Chicken,
   McDonald's, and Barista Coffee have their outlets in major cities. Café
   Coffee Day, again a brainchild of Bangalore-based businessman, is the
   only Indian chain which boasts of hundreds of outlets and is present
   across India. But then it is classified more as a coffee shop than a
   fast food place.

   Now local chains coupled with numerous foreign fast foods have sprung
   up in India, leading to many websites not only catering to the curated
   list of foods, restaurants and reviews but also giving option to book
   and get it delivered at your doorsteps.

Varieties of food offered[edit]

   The kind of fare they offer as of date could be just anything and
   everything. Preference of the local population and the location of the
   outlet influence the menu more than anything else. Some of the popular
   dishes offered at Indian fast food outlets are:
