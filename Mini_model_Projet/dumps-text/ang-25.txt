   Punugulu is essentially made with Idli/Dosa batter and is a deep fried
   snack that’s as crunchy from outside as it’s soft from inside.  Onions,
   coriander and a little yogurt is mixed with the batter to make the
   crunchy balls. These crispy fritters are one of the most popular street
   snacks of AP and are mostly served with an assortment of chutneys.

2) Thukpa from Arunachal Pradesh

   You remember the episode of FRIENDS where Joey messed up his audition
   because he couldn’t say ‘Hmmmm…soup’ and instead kept on saying ‘Noodle
   Soup’. Well, little did he know that he was unknowingly mentioning
   Thukpa because that’s what it is as a whole—noodle soup! A bit spicy, a
   bit hot—it’s made from vegetables and meat and is an ideal supper to
   beat the cold weather.

3) Laksa from Assam

   There’s more to Assam than its splendid tea gardens and picturesque
   locales—and that is its street foods. The most popular one being
   Laksa—which is basically a Malaysian version of spicy noodle soup. It
   consists of the signature Laksa noodles or rice vermicelli cooked in
   tamarind-based fish paste. There are, however, different variants of
   this street food.

4) Litti Chokha from Bihar

   Litti Chokha is to Bihar, what Dal Baati Choorma is to Rajasthan. It’s
   ingenious; it’s ridiculously delicious and is so popular, it’s also
   making its presence known internationally.  The outer crust is made
   from wheat and yogurt whereas the filling is made from Sattu and is
   primarily eaten with ‘Brinjal Bharta’ or mashed potatoes.

5) Faraa from Chhattisgarh

   The steamed dumplings of the north eastern region are known as momos
   whereas in Chhattisgarh, it’s called Faraa (phara). The only difference
   being that this popular snack is made from rice. The dish is seemingly
   easy to make but the dough, which is extremely delicate, becomes a tad
   tough to handle.  Served with green chutney, the delectable taste of
   the dish is totally worth it in the end.

6) Chorizo Pao from Goa

   Chorizo is a type of a spicy pork sausage, so, needless to say this
   dish is only for pork-eating non-vegetarians. But, if you’re in Goa now
   or anytime later, do try this finger-licking good delicacy. Apart from
   adding some spices and herbs, this dish is eaten with soft bread (pao).
   Yummers all the way!

7) Dabeli from Gujarat

   Dabeli is the desi version of American burger where tangy potato mash
   is sandwiched between buns, top-laced with pomegranate, onion and sev.
   It’s mostly served with garlic chutney but always tastes heavenly.

8) Dahi Samosa from Haryana

   This tangy, sweet chat dish is a popular roadside snack of Haryana.
   Greased and golden friend samosas with onion and potato filling are
   broken down into chunks, and are then laced with copious amounts of
   sweet curd, green and tamarind chutney. Enough said!

9) Sidu from Himachal Pradesh

   Sidu is a kind of a yeast-induced soft bread which is made of wheat
   flour and eaten with either desi ghee, dal or meat curry. A must try!

10) Kalari Kulcha from Jammu and Kashmir

   This rather famous kulcha of Kashmir is made from Kalari cheese (which
   is known as Maish Krej) and thus the name! It’s a round baker’s bread
   split open and warmed on a flat surface, topped with onions, tomatoes
   and cheese, of course. This cheese is so heavenly and is found only in
   J&K; in fact, it’s actually J&K’s best kept secret yet.

11) Barra from Jharkhand

   Barra or bara is a traditional delicacy made of tablets of thick rough
   dough of grams (dal or even rice) and is filled with grated onions and
   chillies. One of the easier dishes of Jharkand to make.

12) Banana Buns from Karnataka

   Of course, the idlis, dosas and uttapam are very much a part of
   Karnataka’s street food culture, but there is something more exotic and
   sumptuous about the Mangalore-based banana buns of Karnataka. Unlike
   the regular baked buns, banana buns are made solely out of mashed
   banana mixture and flour which is then kneaded to dough and fermented
   for a few hours. They are mildly sweet but go very well with spicy
   chutney.

13) Parippu Vadu from Kerala

   Parippu Vadu, or more commonly recognized as dal vada, is a crunchy and
   spicy evening appetizer which is mostly served alongside tea. In fact,
   eating tea with those yummy vadas on a beautiful rainy day makes for
   #lifegoals.

14) Pohe-Jalebi from Madhya Pradesh

   The combination may sound bizarre but it’s actually MP’s (or Indore
   specifically) most sought-after street food. Served in breakfast along
   with sev and nukti, this specialty from heart of India can’t be missed!

15) Keema Pao from Maharashtra

   Before you chastise me for not mentioning the beloved ‘Vada Pao’, hear
   me out! Vada Pao is not just a street food of Maharashtra, it’s an
   emotion which not only Indians, but even the world is familiar with
   now. So, it’s only fair to give a fair chance to another equally tasty,
   if not more, street food which is keema pao—minced meat with buttered
   bread. Salivating already?

16) Kelli Chana from Manipur

   A delightful and a rather filling snack found on the streets of the
   beautiful Manipur, it used to be made with chickpeas originally but is
   now made from the spicy yellow peas and served on a lotus leaf. The
   aroma of the leaf is said to enhance the taste of the dish.

17) Kappa from Meghalaya

   A local delicacy which is made from chicken entrails cooked with
   cooking soda and boiled with fresh garden spices. Kappa is a hot dish
   which is perfect for the dewy weather of Meghalaya. It’s an acquired
   taste, but once you get used to this dish—it’s straight out heaven on
   your platter.

18) Arsa Buhchiar from Mizoram

   The food of Mizoram is quite similar to that of other north eastern
   states, generally mild with lots of vegetables and meat. Arsa Buhchiar,
   which is mainly a chicken pudding, is no different! It is a kind of
   special rice made with chicken and veggies and a must, must have.

19) Kinalas from Nagaland

   This popular noodle dish of Nagaland is comfort food at its best. The
   broth is made from either beef or pork head (well yes!) that is
   tenderly boiled and the soup is topped with a brown sauce. Yummy in
   your tummy!

   An accompaniment to most evening tea time snacks, guguni is a delicious
   snack which is mildly spicy when made at home, but roadside vendors
   tend to be a little more generous with spices. Black gram or yellow
   peas is cooked in traditional eastern Indian gravy and mostly served
   with puffed rice (moori) on the roads.

21) Chole Bhature from Punjab

   throughout Rajasthan. The crispy and flaky kachoris are deep-fried
   until they’re golden brown and then stuffed with a rather appetizing
   onion filling and served with a tangy tamarind chutney. Need we say
   more?

23) Momos from Sikkim

   Momos hands down remain unbeatable when it comes to the most popular
   dish of the seven sisters.  Eaten enthusiastically all over India, it’s
   Tibetan steamed dumplings stuffed with minced meat or veggies and eaten
   with a fiery tomato chutney or along with Thukpa.

   One of the most mouth-watering street dishes of India and especially in
   Uttar Pradesh, Aloo Tikki Chaat is enjoyed by both vegetarians and
   non-vegetarians alike. Hot and crunchy potato cutlets straight off the
   pan, broken into tiny pieces and mixed with tangy green and tamarind

   Kolkata’s authentic Jhalmuri is a tangy, spicy, crispy albeit healthy
   popular street snack of West Bengal. It’s actually a cousin of the
   famous Bhel Puri of Maharashtra—the only difference being it doesn’t
   have a sweet chutney and is made out of mustard oil. It’s also a
   delightful tea-time snack!
