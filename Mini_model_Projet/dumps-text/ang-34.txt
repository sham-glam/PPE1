   World Cuisine, India

   As one of the most populous countries in the world, India showcases a
   diverse blend of cultures and regional identities, which have been
   shaped throughout history. The best way to experience this while in
   India is through cuisine.

   Due to religious influences, India actually has the highest rate of
   vegetarianism in the world. Throughout history, the Mongolians,
   Persians, Chinese, and European colonizers influenced the cuisine in
   India. Today, Indian cuisine is most notably known for being flavorful,
   due to its diverse use of spices.

Read on to find out about India’s cuisine and street food.

Background information of Indian cuisine

   You may have noticed that most traditional Indian dishes are meatless,
   including Channa Masal, Saag Paneer, and Malai Kofta. This is because
   about a third of people in India are vegetarian, due to Hindu, Jain, or
   Buddhist faiths. When exploring India’s restaurant scene or street
   foods, you’ll see that dishes are labeled as “Non-Veg” because the
   default is vegetarian; “non-veg '' means it has meat!

   The Ayurvedic philosophy is quite prominent in Indian culture, which
   highlights the importance of balance between mind, body, and spirit.
   This directly influences the way people cook and enjoy food in India.
   You can see this incorporated into the cuisine, which varies greatly
   based on the region. The country's culinary essence does have certain
   threads that unite the variety of practices and techniques.

    A key component that characterizes Indian cuisine is the heavy use of
   7 fundamental spices, which include cumin, clove, coriander, cinnamon,
   turmeric, fenugreek, and cardamom.  You’ll also find numerous other
   spices in Indian cuisine like chili pepper, ginger, garlic, turmeric,
   saffron, nutmeg, mustard seeds, and even mint.
   For Westerners, the most familiar spice mix is called Garam Masala
   which simply means “hot spice mix.” This is used in the most common
   Indian dish, curry. Filled with spices, vegetables, and legumes, these
   gravy-like dishes are a staple to the Indian diet, usually enjoyed with
   iconic basmati rice or fluffy naan bread.

India’s Regional Cuisine

   Cooking styles and techniques vary in Northern, Western, Eastern, and
   Southern India. Below we’ll explore these regional varieties of Indian
   food.

Northern India

   The most common style found outside of India is probably Northern
   Indian cuisine, with high use of dairy products like milk, yogurt, ghee
   (clarified butter), and paneer (a semi-soft, non-aged cheese with a
   mild flavor).

   Northern snacks consist of samosas and pastries that are fried and
   filled with potatoes. Main dishes, commonly cooked in tandoors or clay
   ovens, are chicken stews, dal (lentils), paneer curries, or kormas are
   stews made with coconut milk or yogurt. You can immerse yourself in
   Indian cuisine in our small-group tour to Northern India.

   more elements, like fried onions, pakoras, and thick creamy tomato
   gravy. Photo: Shachi Bakliwal

Western Indian

   This cuisine is influenced by geographical history in its three main
   regions. The first region is Goa, a major trade port and once a colony
   of Portugal. Goan cuisine includes more vinegar, pork, and beef, which
   directly correlates to the Portuguese way of cooking and eating.

   The second one is Gujarat, a region known for being prominently
   vegetarian and with a strong Chinese influence. The climate of this
   region is drier, and vegetables are more scarce. This is why this
   region is known for chutneys and pickled vegetables for
   preservation. Lastly, Maharashtra is a region known for fish and
   seafood curries cooked in coconut milk.

Eastern India

   Eastern Indian cuisine is known for its desserts, which are lightly
   sweetened and the perfect way to finish a meal. A very common dessert
   is called rasgulla, which is a sweet semolina and cheese ball boiled in
   light sugar syrup. There are also a number of popular deep-fried
   desserts from this region, such as Theukua and Pantua.

Southern India

   South Indian cuisine is very diverse, unique, and underrated on an
   international level. They are known for their poriyals, a drier version
   of a curry packed with vegetables and enjoyed with a side of rice.
   Samabars and rasams are stews or soups, cooked with peas and tamarind,
   making sweet and tangy sauces. Apart from curries, this region of India
   has its own version of savory crepes called dosas made from rice flour
   and filled with vegetables and chutneys.

India Street Food: Dos and Don’ts

   Street food in India has a culture of its own; however before you dig
   into it while traveling there, there are some do’s and don’ts to follow
   to avoid any angry tummies.
    1. Do not fear any fried or roasted snacks.
       Fried or roasted goodies have been cooked in very hot temperatures,
       meaning all or most bacteria are completely removed. Some examples
       are samosas, aloo tikkis, dosas, jalebis (similar to funnel cakes),
       and even roasted nuts. Look for snacks that come straight out of
       the hot oil; avoid those that have been sitting or are cooled.
    2. Use caution with foods that include dairy. Though Indians, by and
       large, do not eat beef, as cows are holy, you will find an
       abundance of dairy. Unpasteurized and fresh dairy spoils faster and
       more easily in heat, including things like dahi puri or
       yogurt-based sauces. When consuming dairy, look for hot sources
       (such as paneer in your hot curry) or a piping hot chai masala. For
       yogurt-based dishes such as the popular lassi be sure to choose a
       trusted and clean vendor. As your local guide for suggestions.
    3. Check water sources. Look for vendors that use packaged water for
       cleaning of the food. And on that note, avoid fresh, raw greens but
       rather opt for those that are cooked and served hot.
    4. Do not buy pre-sliced fruit. Even though fruits like watermelon or
       cantaloupe look vibrant, delicious, and refreshing when cut on the
       street, they are susceptible to bacteria when laying under the sun
       or in hot weather for too long.
    5. Always have your own reusable water bottle and filter. While
       wandering the streets of India, always have your own reusable water
       bottle and water filters to prevent dehydration. Also, seek water
       from the most reliable sources.

Must-Try Street Foods While in India

   A country as diverse as mentioned above, India is a foodie’s paradise,
   filled with opportunities to taste local delicacies that are unlike
   anything you have tried before. Here are some of our favorites:
     * Masala Chai is an Indian beverage made from brewed black tea with a
       mixture of aromatic spices, such as green cardamom seeds, cinnamon,
       cloves, and black pepper. It is traditionally served in clay cups
       and enjoyed hot.
     * Paan is not a food per-say, it is a chewing experience that has
       been practiced for more than 2,500 years. This after-dinner treat
       consists of betel leaf and is enjoyed with a variety of flavors and
       textures put on top. This traditional Southeast Indian treat is
       meant to give freshness, aid with digestion, and leave a sweet note
       after a savory meal. It is also meant to symbolize royalty.
     * Kachori is a unique and satiating snack similar to empanadas. They
       can be found in Delhi and Jaipuri, and consists of a spicy
       deep-fried patty made of flour and filling made of lentils, beans,
       and many spices.

     * Aloo Chaat is another common snack found all over the streets of
       India. It is made of potatoes, sweet and sour tamarind chutneys,
       coriander leaves, and ground spices, and garnished with crunchy sev
       made from chickpea flour. In Hindi, Aloo means potatoes and chaat
       stands for “a mix of sweet, sour, and hot flavors;”  hence the name
       of this delicious street food treat.

     * Samosas are a popular appetizer or snack, quite similar to the
       previously mentioned kachoris, but with a triangular shape, and are
       fried or baked. They are usually stuffed with ground potatoes,
       onions, and peas, and are enjoyed with a side of mint or tomato
       chutney.
     * Lassi is a creamy and tangy yogurt-based drink, that originated in
       the region of Punjab, and has become quite a popular beverage
       around the country, and the world too. The yogurt blend is flavored
       with Indian spices, such as roasted cumin, but the sweet version is
       blended with sugar and fruits.

     * Pani Puri is hollow deep-fried semolina or wheat balls
       traditionally served with potatoes, chickpeas, and a spicy tamarind
       sauce, that are used as filling once cracking the fried ball’s top.
       They are enjoyed on the streets throughout the whole nation but are
       known to originate from up north in the state of Bihar.
