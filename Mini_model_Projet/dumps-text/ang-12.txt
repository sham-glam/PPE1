Fast Food Onslaught on Culinary Culture

Fast food chains have launched an onslaught on our traditional food habits,
especially of our youth. Healthy eating behaviours should be kindled during
childhood by fostering a feeling of pride in our local food culture and by
promoting their health benefits

   One pizza a month,” reads a wedding contract signed by newlyweds of
   Assam in their mid-twenties. Mintu Rai, 25, married his college
   sweetheart and “a pizza freak” 24-year-old Shanti Prasad in June 2022
   and the 16-second video of the bride and the groom signing the piece of
   paper has been viewed 45 million times on Instagram, reads a report in
   the BBC news portal on July 17 this year.

   The story also quotes Raghav Thakur, the couple’s friend and the brain
   behind the surprise wedding contract. “She takes it as a joke. She
   keeps complaining that she’s put on 3-4 kg in the past few years, but I
   don’t think that she’s really serious about cutting down on her pizza
   consumption,” he says, laughing.

   He’s right, says Shanti, and adds, “We’ve already had pizzas twice
   since the wedding and it’s only been two weeks.”

   It is easy to laugh and shrug off the above anecdote, but in reality,
   it is no laughing matter. It speaks volumes about how fast food has
   seeped into Indian culture and has altered the eating habits of our
   future – our youth. It also tells us about the addictive nature of fast
   foods and the link between fast food and weight gain or obesity.

   Such a radical change in the eating habits of a population is a clear
   sign of a cultural loss leading to the complete desertion of culinary
   traditions. Across the nation, millions, perhaps billions, are
   currently developing tastes that will sustain for the rest of their
   lives – one of the great American conquests of our time. McDonald’s,
   Pizza Hut, KFC, and other stereotypical American fast-food chains stay
   popular and their offerings go very well with the modern lifestyle of
   Indians. All of the top 10 fast-food brands in the world have their
   roots in the US.

   Fast Food Kills

   There can be no discussions about the fact that fast food is not
   healthy — in fact it kills.
   [INS: :INS]

   Worldwide, regardless of whether you eat it or not, fast food and its
   consequences have become inescapable. They are definitely ruining the
   health of young consumers. If someone calls this as the unhealthiest
   generation the world has ever seen, we should further add the dire
   truth that this generation is going to have a shorter lifespan compared
   to their parents, in spite of all the advances in medicine and health
   care.

   As a society, we are ﬂooded with research reports telling us how the
   quick and tasty bites at fast food restaurants are killing us slowly.
   Bad diet is a bigger killer than any other risk factor in the world. It
   is not the pathogens in food that are shortening our life span, but it
   is the super-sized servings of unhealthy, non-nutritious food.

Fast food can make you impatient

   Merely thinking about fast food can make you feel hurried. Just looking
   at the logos of fast-food companies is enough to affect our attitude
   and judgment. Diﬃcult to believe? But these are the results reported by
   researchers at the University of Toronto, published in March 2010 issue
   of Psychological Science. They found that people who spent time
   examining leading fast-food logos were more likely to exhibit
   impatience and rush in executing subsequent tasks, compared with a
   control group that viewed unrelated shapes of similar size and the
   logos of inexpensive sit-down chain restaurants.

   In another experiment, two groups of people – one group who
   subconsciously viewed fast-food logos and the other who were not
   exposed to the logos – were given the task of reading certain passages
   with no time limit. The group that viewed the logos of the fast food
   companies subconsciously read the passages more quickly as compared to
   the group that were not exposed to the logos. Researchers also found
   that households with more fast-food restaurants in the neighbourhood
   have lower levels of savings, even after accounting for variables like
   income, education, and socialisation than those with fewer fast-food
   outlets.

   According to ‘Global Burden of Disease Study’ by the US-based Institute
   for Health Metrics and Evaluation, unhealthy eating killed 11 million
   people in 2017, up from 8 million in 1990, while smoking kills only
   about 8 million people a year.

   The changing eating habits are already starting to show their impact on
   our health. India is facing a tsunami of non-communicable diseases
   (NCDs). Children and youth are falling victim to diseases that were
   previously never seen in those age groups, like type 2 diabetes and
   fatty liver disease. There is also a manifestation of increased rates
   of adult diseases like hypertension or coronary artery diseases in the
   young.

   Fast food impairs cognitive and mental health
   [INS: :INS]

   Even though it has long been established that diet impacts physical
   health issues – including risk for conditions like obesity, heart
   disease, and diabetes – the idea that food may aﬀect cognitive and
   mental health is a relatively new area of medicine.

   For many years, the medical ﬁeld was unaware of or did not fully
   acknowledge the connection between our brain functions and the food we
   consume. But today, fortunately enough, there is a ﬂood of information
   on this subject.

   A number of studies have been published recently in reputed
   international journals investigating connection between food and brain
   functions have determined that sugar and junk food shrinks the brain,
   limits learning and memory, impairs cognition, is addictive, negatively
   impacts mood, even heightens the risk for degenerative brain diseases
   like Alzheimer’s.

   This is very significant considering the fact that 70 per cent of
   mental health problems arise during adolescence. It is a known fact
   today that the processed foods lead not only to functional changes but
   also structural changes in the brain and these changes occur much
   before the development of apparent changes in the body like obesity.

   Obesity: An Emerging Health Crisis

   India today is not only the fifth economic power also it has broken
   into the top five countries in terms of adult obesity. Obesity is
   mainly a problem of modern India, teeming with fast food outlets and
   American-style malls.

   The prevalence of obesity among Indians increased in 2019-21 compared
   to 2015-16, as per the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) data.
   Nearly one in every four persons is overweight compared to one in every
   five earlier. Also, according to UNICEF’s World Obesity Atlas for 2022,
   India is predicted to have one in 10 obese children globally, by 2030.

   Obesity increases the risk of NCDs, including type-2 diabetes, 13 types
   of cancer, heart problems and lung conditions, leading to premature
   deaths. Multiple studies have shown the association of paediatric and
   adolescent obesity with obesity in adults. Almost half of overweight
   adults were overweight as children.

   Obesity is by far the single most serious medical condition faced by
   children today. The gravity of the situation faced by obese children
   was well brought out in a report published in the Journal of the
   American Medical Association that equated the quality of life of an
   obese child with that of a cancer patient undergoing chemotherapy.

   All health problems are sad, but it is particularly regrettable that so
   many otherwise healthy children are being burdened from such an early
   age by a totally preventable health condition.

   Lure Tactics

   In the early 1990s, a dashing young model zoomed her way into Indian
   living rooms, endorsing a carbonated drink laden with sugars. The
   epoch-making advertisement continues to be remembered even today and is
   cited as one of the successes of the Indian ad world. Even while
   acknowledging the creativity and effort that went behind it, what
   should not be forgotten is how it came to influence our Indian palate.
   It told young gullible viewers that consuming carbon-high drinks was
   indeed a right choice!

   It will bring a smile to our dear readers when they know that India is
   growing younger, when the world is getting older. The average Indian
   was only 29 years old in 2020, one of the youngest in the world. By
   2030, the average age in India will become 29.7 years.

   In 2030, India with a population of 1.4 billion and younger than any
   other major economy in the world, will have tremendous opportunity for
   both economic progress and improvement in the general wellbeing of its
   citizens.

   A more interesting development will be by 2030; when Internet will be
   accessed by more than one billion Indians, both rural and urban as well
   as old and young. Accordingly, nine out of 10 children above the age of
   15 will be online. While this is a great achievement, it is also the
   target population of the global fast food companies, who will step up
   their marketing efforts to reach them. The Internet and social media
   are the latest armours at the disposal of the fast food companies. Not
   surprisingly, the fast-food industry is the sector with the highest
   online engagement rates.

   An added advantage for them is that 80 per cent or more of the Indian
   population access internet through their mobile phones, which is
   expected to increase to more than 90 per cent over the coming years.
   This will be a signiﬁcantly diﬀerent proﬁle of connected consumers
   compared to the US, the UK and even China where nearly half of Internet
   users today access the web primarily through desktops.

   The fast-food industry has effectively leveraged factors such as
   demographic dividend, deepening technology and Internet penetration,
   growth in organised retail, convenience and changing consumer
   consumption patterns.

   According to American Dietetic Association, exposure of children to
   food commercials for just 30 seconds is enough to influence their food
   choices. Children see thousands of slick, clever, appealing
   advertisements each week. Armed with sophisticated psychological
   research and marketing techniques, fast-food industry target children
   in the global digital media landscape. In this area, both children and
   food marketers are active, while parents have little awareness.

   The prevailing pattern of food and beverage consumption of youth and
   children in India who represent the major demographic share of our
   population, is at best, a missed opportunity, and, at worst, a direct
   threat to the future of the nation.

   In most countries, healthcare and welfare systems are legal pyramid
   schemes; that is, lots of young, healthy people, ﬁnancially sound are
   at the bottom and the few old, sick people are at the top. What if the
   country’s healthcare system becomes overburdened by the inﬂux of young
   patients? Without a solid foundation, the whole pyramid collapses, and
   that is really what seems imminent.

   It is a matter of sadness that Western foods have now transformed into
   the ‘new traditional Indian diet’ of the country’s youth. The
   demographic and digital advantage that the nation has at present should
   not get destroyed through mindless junk eating.

   War is not lost yet

   What is needed to thwart this increasing inclination for consumption of
   fast foods is a massive awareness about our traditional food systems,
   its advantages and the vital role it has played in up keeping the
   health of our elderly.

   Traditional Indian food has always been about abundance and
   wholesomeness, with the right balance of proteins, carbohydrates, fat
   and other nutrients to meet the body’s requirements. A regular Indian
   home-cooked meal contains various staples like rice, chapati, daal and
   curry along with pickles, chutneys, papads, salad and raita. The family
   meal is also about socialising and strengthening ties between the
   members who share the meal.

Fast foods make the brain shrink

   Your pancreas produces more insulin when you eat lots of fatty fast
   food. It is well known that increased insulin production can lead to
   insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Much scarier is the fact that
   it could also lead you to dementia. Insulin resistance aﬀects brain’s
   ability to create and store memories, thereby increasing the risk of
   dementia. Researchers even call Alzheimer’s ‘the diabetes of the
   brain’. The hippocampus helps us control short-term and long-term
   memories. With a functioning hippocampus, we receive
   fullness-signalling messages from the gut and the memories related to
   food may get blocked so that we are not tempted to eat by the sight,
   smell, or thought of something delicious. Once the hippocampus is
   damaged, people feel hungry all the time, leading to obesity.
   A study published in the Royal Society Open Science in 2020 by a few
   researchers from Macquarie University in Sydney examined the eﬀects
   that fast food can have on our mental state, its functions, and their
   results. The shocking result was that it takes only a week for these
   processed foods especially the western style meal to have a notable
   eﬀect in the hippocampus region of the brain leading to a cycle of
   fast-food binging and overeating.

   India still has the advantage as we have not lost our culture of real
   food. Home cooking has not stopped altogether and there are millions
   still who eat frugal but nutritious home-cooked meals with local
   ingredients.

     The fast-food industry has effectively leveraged factors such as
     demographic dividend, deepening technology and Internet penetration,
     growth in organised retail, convenience and changing consumer
     consumption patterns

   Dietary patterns that begin in childhood give shape to the health
   profiles of the population at all ages. Healthy eating behaviours
   should be kindled during childhood by fostering a feeling of pride in
   our local food culture and by promoting their health benefits.
   Involving children in all stages of traditional meal preparation can
   promote a sense of pride; it can also go a long way in fostering the
   pristine connections between nutrition, nature and livelihoods.

   We have fought invasions, survived their lasting impacts and
   successfully regained lost glories. But today, we seem to be succumbing
   slowly to the pressure of the new invasion, the fast-food culture. Just
   as the East India Company drained wealth of its colonies, now these
   fast food and soft drink multi-nationals are draining the wealth and
   health of our nation.

   As we step into the ‘Amrit Kaal’ – the next 25 years leading to the
   centenary of Indian Independence – as highlighted by our Prime Minister
   Shri Narendra Modi, crafting an environment in which children and youth
   can grow up healthy should be a high priority for the nation if we are
   to have a healthy nation in 2047. For that it is very important to tell
   the fast-food industries to stop playing with human lives. The march of
   armies of the colossal fast-food empire, which has taken vast swathes
   of the globe under its dominion can be stopped in this land, where
   enormous diversity in traditional food culture still continues. This is
   possible only if there is strong public and political will.

   Good food is not the one which is just good for you, but good for the
   society, nation and environment. We need to go back to good food
   practices TODAY for no child should ever die early – or even have to
   suffer – from a condition that is completely preventable.
