Street food of Delhi

     * Street food of Delhi

   The unique culture and cuisine of Delhi displays a generous blend of
   diverse influences. Our rich regional cuisines with time have
   interacted and influenced each other in a way, giving rise to new
   flavours and cuisines. The glorious historical past of Delhi impacted
   its food no less. The cuisines of Delhi saw Hindu-Rajput, Bania,
   Kayastha, Turkish, Arabic, Perian and Mughal influences due to the
   culturally diverse emperors that ruled Delhi over the centuries. The
   influence of Mughal food had the longest influence, so much so that
   Mughal cuisine and Indian cuisine became synonymous. Due to its vibrant
   food tradition- both non-vegetarian and vegetarian, delicacies and
   street food Delhi ranks as the gastronomical of India.
   Our team of city explorers are unsurpassed in knowledge and ensure that
   your walking tour exceeds your expectations. We at Delhi Walks would be
   delighted to be of assistance in planning and executing all
   your sightseeing requirements.

   For the best street food experience visit Old Delhi. It offers a wide
   range of variety. The famous paranthewali gali and lanes of narrow
   lanes of Old Delhi offers the best stuffed breads deep-fried in ghee,
   sweets, chaat, chole bhature, jalebi, rabdi etc. Chole bhature, jalebi
   and warm milk are preferred breakfast. The Jama Masjid area is ideal
   for mouth-watering and tasty non-vegetarian delicacies like mughlai,
   kebabs, tandoori items and Mughal sweetmeats at Ghantewala Sweet etc.
   From Aaloo-Gobi to bhindi-Karela to meva-rabdi you can find everything
   in this exotic area of Delhi. Since Delhi is a cultural hub there
   nothing that you will not find here. If you begin with Old Delhi or
   Purani Dilli you may indulge yourself in exquisite street foods with a
   variety of dishes that you can choose from. In fact there are exclusive
   lanes dedicated to food in this part of Delhi.
   The exclusive lanes dedicated to food has its own range of cuisines.
   You can Nehari at Bismillah and Afghani pulao and green tea at
   Pathanwadi. Kulle, a unique chaat made by scooping out the centre of a
   tomato, banana, cucumber or sweet potatoes and filled with chick peas,
   pomegranate, lemon juice and spices; sandwiches, samosas, tikkis,
   golgappas, papri chaat and tikkis are the all-time favourite of Old
   Delhi. The Kebabs and biryanis from Pandara road, sweetmeats and chaats
   from Bengali market are worth mentioning. Delhi has something to offer
   every food-lover. Whether you want to spend your evening dining in an
   elite boutique restaurant near Connaught Place, Chanakyapuri, Qutub
   Minar, Khan Market, GK I and II, Defence colony or Hauz Khas or a
   simple exotic meal at roadside jam packed “dhabas” Delhi is sure to
   tantalise your taste buds. Above all, Mughlai cuisine has the highest
   demand among outsiders and Delhiites. Mughlai- a cuisine borrowed from
   the Mughals who ruled Delhi in the medieval times is pretty popular in
   Delhi, North India and the world for its spicy flavor and aroma.

   For a mind-numbing food experience try the spicy treats offered at Old
   Delhi, near the Chandini Chowk metro station. Pamper your sweet tooth
   with the Rabri Faludas from Giani’s near Fatehpur Masjid in the same
   area. To experience the best of state foods visit Dilli Haat. Know more
   about your culture and cuisines at this extraordinarily colourful
   market. For Asian, Continental and European cuisines a number of
   restaurants and cafes can be tried at Connaught Place, Saket, Hauz
   Khas, Defence Colony etc. For quick bites, Subways and Mc Donald’s are
   quite popular in Delhi. Do not dread the ‘red and green chili’ used
   greatly in Indian foods for our food has attracted a number of
   Westerners. Lately, European cuisine has gained so much popularity in
   Delhi that a number of fusion restaurants have come up.

   We are expert in walking tours and we’ve earned a solid reputation for
   our passion, enthusiasm and importantly, our sense of showcasing the
   character of the city.
