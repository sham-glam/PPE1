Nirula’s: The place that introduced Delhi to its fast food culture

   Anushka Goel

   On October 5, Deepak Nirula, the man behind the much-popular food
   chain, Nirula’s, passed away. We celebrate his life and achievements as
   we take you on a trip down memory lane to one of the city’s most iconic
   eatery and ice cream parlour.

   The earliest memory that I have of Nirula’s is its classic red chairs,
   bustling crowds and plates filled with delicious food. Long before
   other international pizza chains entered the Indian market and became
   popular, a Nirula’s pizza is what most of Delhi knew. For me, however,
   the most special memory has been showing my report card as a young
   child of six at the counter, and getting a free Hot Chocolate Fudge –
   their best-selling ice cream – as a reward for my scores.

About Nirula’s

   A post shared by Kanpurwants (@kanpurwants)

   The brand, India’s oldest fast food chain, originated as Hotel India by
   Nirula Brothers, Lakshmi Chand Nirula and Madan Gopal Nirula. They soon
   started to open coffee shops and restaurants, before entering the fast
   food business in the 1970s. In 1977, the first fast food restaurant in
   Delhi was opened by the name of Nirula’s, to which, additions such as a
   pastry shop, hot shoppe and an ice cream parlour were later added.

   The outlet became iconic, offering Western treats such as burgers,
   pizzas, submarines and a lot more, which were introduced by Deepak
   Nirula to the brand, along with its ice cream parlour serving 21
   flavours of the delicious dessert.

   The restaurant chain soon opened new outlets, becoming what was
   probably India’s first – and oldest – fast food restaurant chain. It
   attracted customers from nearby towns, and became a part of several
   experiences and ‘firsts’. Be it movies at Chanakya, first dates,
   proposals, birthday parties or more, Nirula’s was the place for all
   occasions, something Delhiites remember fondly to date. The restaurant
   has now expanded to outlets across India and a few in Nepal, too, with
   plans to only grow further.

Nirula’s – a legacy and so much more

   For those born and brought up in Delhi, especially until the 2000’s
   (before international chains took over), Nirula’s brings with it
   bucketsful of nostalgia. I remember dining there every other month.
   After plates of pizzas and sandwiches, it was always time for some ice
   cream, their 21 Love being one of my all-time favourites back then.

   The restaurant had a way to encourage young scholars to do even better
   at school – and this is probably one of my favourite memories from the
   outlet. Each year, my family and I would head to the Nirula’s outlet in
   Connaught Place, bringing report cards of both my brother and I with
   us. Once we were done with our meal, it was always time for some ice
   cream, but before my parents would order, they would present our report
   cards to the cashier. He would then look at us, smile, stamp the card
   and proceed to hand over our free ice cream sundaes – our prize for
   scoring straight A’s or above 90 per cent marks in school – before my
   father an ice cream (usually pineapple or almond praline) for my
   mother.

   Today, limited food is served at even limited outlets, while the
   Nirula’s ice cream parlours have taken over the city. I have one closer
   home, and their popular flavours, such as almond praline, hot chocolate
   fudge and 21 Love, transport me back to the time I was barely six, with
   a report card in my hand, tasting the free ice creams and roaming
   around carefree.

   Available at all the Hot Shoppe outlets, Nirula’s Pizzas are made fresh
   with veggies, cheese, meat, sauces and more. Be it their Margherita or
   pizzas with toppings, each bite will transport you to your childhood!

Burgers

   Nirula’s also introduced the concept of burgers to Delhi. The popular
   fast food snack is still available at Hot Shoppe outlets, with
   delicious fillings and nostalgic flavours.

Hot Chocolate Fudge

   Yes, there are countless brands selling this creamy, warming treat, but
   no one does it like Nirula’s! Their Hot Chocolate Fudge, or HCF, is as
   delicious as it can be. Vanilla ice cream topped with a warm, sticky
   sweet chocolate sauce, covered in nuts that are toasted until golden
   and flavourful – tell me if there’s anything better!

21 Love

   You’ve already seen the name of this flavour multiple times in this
   story, but what exactly is the ice cream? Vanilla, with flakes of
   chocolate through it, making for a basic ice cream that’s been elevated
   to another level. Today, instead of flakes, you’ll find pieces of milk
   chocolate in the ice cream, which are melt-in-the-mouth and simply
   delicious. Oh, and, do try this in a waffle cone to make your ice cream
   experience more indulgent!
