The History of Street Food

   Street food culture has been around for millenia. It’s been sustaining
   the masses in major cities since urbanisation drove many people to find
   work in city centres. To this day, it still serves that purpose with
   densely populated cities like Bangkok, Tokyo and Singapore being the
   street food capitals of the world. Versions of this street food exist
   all over the globe and they’re constantly changing and adapting to suit
   the needs of the people they serve. We explore the multicultural and
   diverse history of street food and how this trend takes shape in South
   Africa today.

What is Street Food?

   Street food is, well, food served on the street. It’s typically served
   from food trucks, carts, hatches or even tables in major city centres
   where foot traffic is high and constant. It serves people who are
   on-the-go and need a quick lunch or dinner, but it also serves those
   who don’t have fully equipped home kitchens. In densely populated
   cities, where residential living space is dwindling, working class
   families often live in very small apartments that don’t have space for
   a kitchen. Street food is sometimes cheaper and more accessible
   compared to buying groceries, and has become common practice for people
   to rely on vendors for daily sustenance.

     Street food is the people’s food, originating from a need to feed
     the working class who couldn’t afford expensive cuisine or
     ingredients.

   In Singapore, street food is mostly served in ‘hawker centres’ which
   are large complexes, occupied by tables and dozens of street food
   vendor hatches. Hawker centres are known to have some of Singapore’s
   tastiest and cheapest food, and many people and families eat there
   everyday. Hawker culture is such an important part of the Singaporean
   way of life that on the 16th of December 2020, it was inscribed on the
   UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of
   Humanity.

     Street food is sometimes cheaper and more accessible compared to
     buying groceries, and has become common practice for people to rely
     on vendors for daily sustenance.

   These days, pretty much any type of meal can be served as street food.
   It’s no longer just meats and salads wrapped in bread, like shawarma,
   or food served on sticks. Some of the most popular street food dishes
   include aloo chaat from Northern India, bahn mi from Northern Vietnam,
   crepes from France, tacos from Mexico and mango sticky rice from
   Bangkok, to name the bare minimum. Street food has become so popular —
   there are several Netflix shows dedicated to documenting the history of
   street food and many more YouTube series highlighting everyday cooks
   who feed the hungry masses. These dishes have become ingrained in
   global food culture that often we aren’t even aware that the dish we
   are eating originated on the street in vendors’ carts.

The People’s Food

   Street food is the people’s food, originating from a need to feed the
   working class who couldn’t afford expensive cuisine or ingredients.
   Nowadays, street food serves to preserve indigenous food cultures
   around the world and vendors can often serve as welcome reminders of
   ‘home’ for those living in foreign cities. In countries like South
   Africa, where there are many cultural groups living in diaspora, some
   of the most popular street food vendors are those making dishes that
   draw inspiration from their cultural heritage and upbringing in South
   Africa.

     During the Apartheid era, when people of colour weren’t allowed to
     sit at restaurants, bunny chow was also a popular way of serving a
     takeaway option.

   The bunny chow, for example, is one of South Africa’s most popular
   street food dishes and it originated in Durban, during the 1940s. Many
   people were brought over from India as indentured labourers and they
   had to find a way of transporting their curries to and from work every
   day. White bread was the cheapest and most accessible bread and so, in
   order to transport their food efficiently, it was hollowed out and used
   as a type of ‘bowl’. During the Apartheid era, when people of colour
   weren’t allowed to sit at restaurants, bunny chow was also a popular
   way of serving a takeaway option (usually out of the back door of the
   kitchen).

A Window to the Past

   Learning about the history of street food culture is an amazing way to
   learn more about the history of a country and the people who have and
   are inhabiting it. Food is one of the few constants that have travelled
   with us over time. We can often gain insight into the way people lived,
   and why, by understanding what cuisines were available to them.
