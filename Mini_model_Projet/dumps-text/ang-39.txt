   The main ingredients of Vietnamese food include shrimp paste, fish

       pork, shrimp or crab.

   There are many things in general you can try, from salads to hot
   dishes, from sweets to soups. But if you want something traditional,
   cheap and fast – it`s definitely souvlaki. The iconic dish of Greece is
   a fast food that you usually can find anywhere on the streets, in the
   bars, in small take-out shops and cafes. You will see souvlaki over the
   whole country. And if you are lucky enough to be invited to a house
   party of Greek people – ask for mousaka. It is the best when it`s
   homemade.

   A little glossary for a newbie:
     * Greak salad – it is called just «salad» in Greece. Be aware of this
       when you order in restaurant.
     * Souvlaki – “Little skewers” in Greek: it`s basically little pieces
       of marinated pork, fried on grill.
     * Mousaka – is an eggplant- or potato-based dish. You definitely
       would want to give it a try.
     * Must-Drink in Greece: ouzo, tsipouro

     * Remember: you wouldn’t want to seem odd in the nightclub – so don’t
       order Tsipouro there. Leave it for quiet evenings in mountains. And
       don’t be silly, don’t order GREEK salad.

   It’s hard to speak about Italian food, it’s better to enjoy it. The
   traditional colors of Italian cuisine – red, green and yellow always
   create a great mixture of flavor and taste. Usually all the dishes are
   based on tomato, bread and olive oil. The secret of the cuisine is not
   in a sophisticated preparation process, it is more in the freshness of
   the products.

   A little glossary for a newbie:
     * Pizza – Margherita, Quattro Formaggi, Speck e Mascarpone & many
       more…
     * Pasta – choose Pesto (from Italian Riviera) or Cacio & pepe and
       Amatriciana (from Rome): these are the best options.
     * Caprese – ask for it just if the ingredients are: original
       mozzarella di bufala, “Cuor di Bue” tomato & Extra virgin Olive
       oil. With a slice of Italian fresh bread, it’s a simple and amazing
       dish.
     * Panna cotta – a creamy dessert made of heaven, usually served with
       red-berry jam.
     * Must-Drink in Italy: Red Wine (Barbaresco, Barolo, Brunello di
       Montalicino & many more…), White wine (Gewürztraminer, Muller
       Thurgau, Chardonnay, Vermentino, Arneis & many more…), Sparkling
       wine (Franciacorta & Prosecco), limoncello, San Pellegrino water.

   Like many other Asian cuisines, Thai cooking uses rice as a basic
   ingredient for the majority of dishes. The word “food” in Thai language
   means literally “to eat rice”. Furthermore, it has 5 main tastes, which

   sauce, hot chilli, salt and sweetness (usually added by palm tree).

   Japanese food is one of a kind. You will never mistake it. Sushi,
   sashimi, unagi, and sake… we all know this. But this cuisine is not
   only about products and recipes, here a lot is about their indigenous
   culture and traditions. It is not surprising then that they made the
   whole world eat with chopsticks instead of knives and forks.

A little glossary for a newbie:

     * Tempura – the Japanese contribution to the world’s love for
       deep-fried foods.
     * Wagashi – sweets, made of red bean paste
     * Unagi – eel
     * Soba and Udon – types of Noodles
     * Tonkatsu – deep-fried pork cutlets
     * Must-Drink in Japan: Yakitori beer, Sake, Tea

   Usually the Japanese serve their food with traditional rice wine –
   sake. It actually tastes more like vodka than wine. What is more – it
   is usually served hot. Be careful when the waiter brings you sake –
   don’t attack it like you’ve just stumbled out of a month in the desert.
   Drink slowly and carefully.
     * Remember: When someone starts to pour you a drink, you should hold
       your glass with both hands and thank him or her.

   It’s all about extremely fat and therefore enormously tasty foods.
   Various pastries, soups, meat dishes and unexpected mixture of tastes –
   you may find all these in Ukrainian cuisine.

   The famous Russian beetroot soup, borsch, actually comes from Ukrainian
   cuisine. Ukrainian borsch is a little bit different than the Russian
   one, but you will hardly notice. Anyways – it rocks.

A little glossary for a newbie:

     * Borsch – a meat-beetroot soup, made with everything that was found
       in the fridge.

   It is not a coincidence that you will find Chinese food pretty much
   everywhere. But remember, there are 2 types of Chinese cuisine –
   authentic and fake. How to identify the first type? Easy. If you are in
   China – it’s all over. If you are in your city’s Chinese restaurant –
   choose the place where customers are Chinese, not tourists.

A little glossary for a newbie:

     * Soy puff – enormously tasteless piece of “bread”, which thought
       will help you not to suffer from all the spicy hot dishes.
     * Tofu – another tasteless food, it is a soy cheese. But when it’s
       fried with spices – nothing`s better.
     * Noodles – they could be made of pretty much anything. Be ready for
       this, and be curious – all these usually taste like heaven.
     * Bird’s nest soup: it is the soup that has been prepared with the
       gelatinous product derived from the nests of cliff-dwelling birds.
       You can imagine, it has a very unusual taste. You should only try
       it if you have extra money to order something as a plan “B”.
     * Chop suey – not only a song by System of A Down. It is also a
       stir-fried dish with meat or shrimps and vegetables (mushrooms,
       water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts). It is usually served
       on rice.
     * Must-Drink in China: Tea or any Chinese beer.

   As we remember, the cow is a sacred animal here and the majority of
   Indians are vegetarians. Traditional Indian food uses many different
   spices and is slathered with  flavourful sauce. They are also big fans
   of Indian homemade white cheese, called Panir. Every dish is
   traditionally accompanied by naan bread. Of course, rice is one of the
   basic products of Indian cuisine as well.

   Concerning alcohol – you would not find it anywhere in India, almost
   nowhere. Only Goa is famous for parties and drinks, because there is no
   alcohol tax here, unlike all other states of India.

A little glossary for a newbie:

     * Paneer Butter Masala – it’s the most popular dish in India, you may
       find it anywhere. It is made of tomato puree with cream and the
       traditional Indian herbs and spices.
     * Aloo Gobi – a side dish, made of potato and cauliflower.
     * Must-Drink in India: Masala Tea, Kingfisher beer, Old Monk rum.

       In Montenegro we like “kačamak”. Polenta, mentioned in your text,
       is not used very much, though made of almost the same ingredients,
       Tourist should try also “cicvara”.

            Xana, good evening!
            Thank you for your comment!
            But I am pretty sure that zrazi are made of meat (I had
            private consultations with 2 Ukrainians :). Don’t you mix it
            up with draniki? 🙂 If not – tell me more about “zrazi made of
            potato”, I can not wait to hear about it!
            Thank you,

                 But zrazi really are made of potato. fried potato patties
                 with different kind of fillings: meat (usually pork or
                 beef), cabbage (I think it is more traditional),
                 mushrooms, cabbage with mushrooms, eggs with onion and so
                 on.

                      That sounds more like what we call kartoplyannyky.
                      Although i think some regions might call it zrazy,
                      but original zrazy are actually from meat with
                      various stuffing.

                           In different regions it can be different
                           names,in Lviv they will say pirogi(in general
                           they call evrething with filling-pirogi). In
                           general if you say zrazi people will
                           understande, them as those made from potato,
                           but you can say meat zrazi and it will be the
                           one that was written in the artical. So it can
                           be left this way.

       Borsch is made not of everything you find in the frindge!
       Obligatory ingredients include cabbage, onion, carrot, potatao,
       oil, water, salt, black pepper, plus additionally beet (to make the
       borsch red) and meat can be added. You can eat it with souer cream

       ruSSian NEVER made borsch!
       They making “shchi”!!!
       Gorilka – homemade Ukrainian vodka. Strong as hell.
       Of course, as gorilka came from “burn” not “water”!
       Zrazi – beef cutlets with different fillings.
       ZrazY! No beef at all! ZrazY its a dish made from grated POTATOS!
       Best served with mushrooms!
       Must-Drink in Ukraine: Gorilka, Black Tea, Cranberry juice and

            I am happy that you commented. Now we know, that in some
            regions of Ukraine zrazi are not made from beef! That’s
            curious, we never heard of it before…
            Talking about borsch – it is sometimes called Russian, because
            in foreigners’ minds it’s usually associated with this
            country. And for centuries Russians really cook Borsch very
            often (even though it was invented in Ukraine).
            Anyways, thank you for your comment,

       I don’t know where you took this information from, but I’m mexican
       and I’ve never seen chilli con carne on the menu of a restaurant in
       Mexico, I’ve only seen it outside the country and I guess that it
       is a Tex-Mex dish, which is different than Mexican food. Also,
       tacos are not crispy corn chips, I think you wanted to say nachos.
       Finally, enchiladas are nothing like lasagna, they are not made out
       of pasta, they are made out of tortillas, they don’t include beef
       or vegetables, they have chicken or cheese inside the tortillas,
       and they are supposed to be covered with a spicy sauce made out of
       chiles not tomatos.

                 Peru is not just “ANOTHER” best country for food. If you

                 times as World’s Best Culinary Destination at the WTA
                 (World Travel Awards) if you don’t know about WTA, it is
                 like “Oscars of tourism”. It is very outrageous see this
                 kind of list without the mention of peruvian food and it
                 is quite perplexed see countries such United states or

                 countries maybe you could find great restaurants and chef
                 from another countries but definitely these countries not
                 have the best culinary culture and food

                      Actually I know about WTA, but my article was not

       You should probably remove India from your list. Because everything

       is vegetarian, more than 50% of Indians are non-vegetarians.

       How do you get the ingredients wrong on a Caesar salad? It’s not
       iceberg lettuce, it’s romaine. Romaine, parmesan, croutons, and
       Caesar dressing. Chicken only comes if it’s a whole meal. Maybe
       cherry tomatoes.
       But saying iceberg lettuce makes me skeptical about this entire

       I love your post,there is a lot of food that you mention here that
       I have to try. However, I hope you are not listing the food in
       order of what I should try. If so I think that Mexican food should
       be in the top five with Thai, Indian, Chinese, and Italian. Of
       course, that is just my personal preference.

       most of the food description you put in Mexico is actually Tex-Mex
       food, which is a blend between northern Mexican states and the
       state of Texas

       Interesting article. However, ur way off regarding the
       vegetarianism and alcohol part. There r few dry states but
       everywhere else its legally available. The difference is the
       restrictions regarding its sale. For example, u won’t find it in
       regular grocery stores or departmental stores but u will find it
       designated liquor stores. Also statistically 40% of indians r
       vegeterian. And in must try u should also mention non veg dishes
       like butter chicken, hyderabadi biryani. Tandoori chicken which u
       attributed to Pakistan originated and widely available in India.

       Not sure whether you have actually had a taste of Indian food.
       Totally agree to the previous comment as well. All your
       observations are stupid. India have many cuisines and the north is
       totally different to the south. Plenty of meat dishes and plenty of
       meat eaters; alcohol, plenty of them as well.

       Every country has a rich culinary history and can offer foreign
       travelers something delicious to find and eat ! If you are not too
       fussy or a food-snob of sorts, you should be able to get a good
       meal just about anywhere in the world. All countries have fresh
       fruits and vegetables, grilled meats, rice, starches, noodles,
       breads, salads, desserts, sweets and so on. Albeit in various
       different forms, cooked in different ways, served in different
       sauces and prepared with often strange and exotic condiments and
       spices. That is the beauty of travelling abroad and far and wide.
       If you are not willing to try and explore foreign foods and try
       experience local dishes, what is the point of travelling in the
       first place ?

       Pljeskavica ain’t Montenegrin cuisine, it’s purely Serbian,
       although Montenegro people are practically Serbs. In fact,
       Pljeskavica’s national dish of Serbia and, yes, you may check it
       out yourself.
       Also, your blog only lists countries which you may’ve visited. I
       know that a lot of Russians go to Montenegro each year so it’s no
       wonder, but not staying at Serbia and eating Serbian food is a
       serious loss. You should take at least 2 weeks in order to travel
       Serbia and stay in Vojvodina as well as Zlatibor and Leskovac.
       First of all it’s the best BBQ ever made on the planet Earth. Only
       Argentinian BBQ comes close to it.
       Second of all, Serbia’s cuisine is one of the richest cuisines in
       the world offering a huge variety for anyone who’s into gastronomy.
       Montenegro can’t really relive that sense made in Serbia.
       Here’s a deal, just google Serbian food or Serbian meze or Serbian
       breakfast or whatever comes to your mind ranging from river-fish up
       to the full-scale roasted pig or lamb. It’s a huge deal in Serbia.
       Next deal is – meet Serbian people and bond up to the point where
       you can go and visit a specific sort of a deal – SLAVA. Yes,
       slava’s the epitome of the Serbian gastronomical experience based
       on the religious views of Orthodox Christianity and is a must to
       visit.
       Another deal – check the youtube videos of the particular
       individual called Charles Cather and see what he talks about
       Serbian cuisine.

       Hello Anastasia!
       I am from India and I am a little disappointed in how you’ve
       portrayed India.
       More than half the population here is non-vegetarian. I don’t think
       you’ve tried a lot of dishes if you’re calling paneer butter masala
       the most popular dish in India. It is popular, yes, but not the
       most popular. You should try pani puri (also called golgappa),
       idlis, dosas, samosas, malai kofta, palak paneer, avial, dal
       makhni, paneer tikka, dhokla, and a long list of others in the
       vegetarian end. For your non-vegetarian side, you could try the
       Chicken Biryani, Mutton Biryani, and Egg Biryani, made of basmati
       rice and that define the city of Hyderabad in the country.
       I don’t know if you think that the food here is unclean but that is
       a huge, glaring misconception that is being spread about my
       country.
       Please do some research before resorting to unnecessary mudslinging
       on a beautiful, beautiful country!
       No offense meant! 🙂

       Around 35% of indians are vegetarians. The rest aren’t. It’s common
       to assume India to be a vegetarian country, but that’t far from the
       truth. It’s likely that India has the largest proportion of
       vegetarians compared to any other country, and that’s about it.

       not just Istanbul, the entire country which hosted 100s of

       Whoever made this is just copying and paste from another webiste.
       How can american food be in this list? a country where fast food is
       the supremacy and then you mention the steaks?. Please go to
       Argentina and you will know what a real steak is. go to Peru and
       you will the most creative and diverse food. A cheeseburger can be
       done in any country if there is good meat. You judgment should be
       based on creativity, innovation, uniqueness and popularity. How can
       a cheeseburger be unique?

       Indians drink alcohol and you can find it anywhere. There are
       awesome bars everywhere in country where you can combine your meal
       with nice beers and whiskey.

       I am surpised no African cuisines were mentioned? What about
       Morocco, Ethiopia etc? Also no middle east Lebanese and Turkish are
       one of my favs. Also Iran has some pretty amazing foods. Much
       better than USA, Australia or Sweden I would say.

       Majority of the Indians are Vegetarians? Almost every dish is
       accompanied by naan bread? Alcohol is not available in India except
       Goa? WTF?
       Majority of the Indians (i.e. 75%) are non-vegetarians. Naan bread
       is popular in Northern part of India. In the South it is not part
       of our culture. I cannot think of a city or town that doesn’t have
       Alcohol in India except for the state of Bihar where alcohol is
       banned.

       Hey! On Portuguese Cusine theres a few things misspelled and one
       other thing wrong!
       Bacalhau is not raw fish, it ‘s Cod Fish, there is multiple ways we
       cook it, bread crumbs on top, with potatos etc etc.
       its Pasteis de Nata and not Pateis de Natal!
       Alzeida I suppose you are talking about Alheira which is a typical
       sausage (as you said).
       Pollo Rosto, this one i really dont know what it is, and Pollo and
       Rosto are written in what I imagine to be spanish because those 2
       words dont exist in the Portuguese Language!
       Hope I could be of help to you!

       You have done a valuable job, but food taste is very subjective and
       I believe Persian cuisine is absolutely missing or Turkish cuisine
       as well. Greek kitchen (Turkish kitchen is smaller size) is derived
       from turkish one during otteman empire based on historical facts.
       Thank you for what you have done.

       have you ever been to India? such a shame posting negative reviews
       about India. I visited India last summer with my uncle and grandpa
       and you can find non-vegetarian food everywhere! and alcohol is not
       banned.duh.if you would have visited India even once you would know
       all you have written is bullshit and make sure food is cooked in
       front of you? my my my. I have noticed unhygiene in India but a
       good and clean restaurant with good food and alcohol can be found
       everywhere. research before you post.

       You cannot find alcohol almost anywhere in India!! lolz. I think
       you have not visited India real well. May be some of us are
       vegetarian but mostly we all eat non veg. Therefore you didn’t
       mention the sumptuous non veg dishes we have like lamb/chicken
       biriyani, chichen reshmi butter masala, murg masallam, Kerala fish
       curry, baked/steamed hilsa (a local fish) in mustard sauce (locally
       called Ilish machh vapa) and so on.
