   Homesickness grabs you by the throat, but food-sickness sinks its claws
   into your stomach and won’t let go until you get that back-home food
   you crave: The dish your mother fed you as a kid; the after-school
   snack you looked forward to all day; the meal only your hometown can
   get right.
   Finding American food isn’t easy — tougher still because the cuisine
   defies easy definition, being inspired mostly by immigrants — but for
   any one born in the USA, they know what it is. I thought it impossible
   to find the New York Deli sandwich outside of Manhattan, or the zing of
   Cajun fish outside Louisiana. And certainly not the Jewish water bagel.
   American food is here, all over India, and not just in tourist towns or
   five star hotels. So, if you’re a homesick expat, or an Indian looking
   for that nebulous “American” cuisine, come ’n’ get it!
   The All-Day Breakfast
   A meal that will leave you loosening your belt and closing your eyes in
   a food hangover for hours afterward, but it’s well worth it.  Fluffy
   waffles, stacks of pancakes, fatty burgers, hot dogs, malts and shakes
   are ubiquitous 50s American diner food, and the All-American Diner ,
   New Delhi, has it all in true greasy form.
   The All-American Diner, Habitat World at India Habitat Centre, Lodhi
   Road, New Delhi.
   Tel: 011 43663162
   The East Coast Jewish Bagel
   The bagel with cream cheese is the staple New York American Jewish
   breakfast. The ideal bagel is topped with salt and malt and then boiled
   in water before baking it in an oven, and is puffy with a moist crust.
   At the Bagel Shop, Mumbai, their holey bread isn’t exactly the real
   deal. But I won’t kvetch too much — because although they skipped out
   on the salt and malt, they do make real ‘water’ bagels. That alone
   makes it worth the trip, even for goys.
   The Bagel Shop, Anand Villa, 13 Pali Mala Road, Bandra West, Mumbai.
   Tel: 022 26050178
   West Coast Raw Foodism
   American health gurus embraced raw foodism, and California totally
   adopted it. The promise: eating uncooked and unprocessed food promises
   a beach-ready body! (Believe it or not, it can also taste great). At
   the hippie-inspired Mocha Mojo (Chennai and Mumbai), you can eat a
   whole raw food garden lasagna before you realise they used almond paste
   instead of cheese.
   Mocha Mojo, 72, 1st Avenue, Indra Nagar, Adyar, Chennai.
   Tel: 044 42337025
   Down South BBQ
   Summer and backyard get-togethers and Independence Day celebrations
   just wouldn’t be complete without a dad in an apron messing with the
   charcoal grill, hovering over the meat. At The Barbeque, Taj Bengal,
   Kolkata , they use a gas fire, but the result is the same: Sizzling
   chargrilled chicken, pork chops and lamb.
   The Barbeque, Taj Bengal, 34B, Belvedere Road, Alipore, Kolkata.
   Tel: 033 22233939
   The New York Deli Sandwich
   A Deli sandwich says a lot about a person. What kind of bread? And
   which cold cut do you want: Turkey? Roast beef? Then choose your
   cheese; and then how many toppings; and what kind of sauce; the type of
   wet salad. The counter of the Indigo Deli , Mumbai, is so well stocked
   it’s nightmare for the indecisive. But it’s an NYC foodie’s dream.
   The Indigo Deli, 5, Pheroze Building, Chattrapati Shivaji Maharishi
   Marg, Apollo Bunder, Mumbai.
   Tel: 022 6655 1010

   The Cops-on-Breaks-Inspired Doughnut
   American movie fans know that all highway cops really do is hang out in
   coffee shops and eat doughnuts. But hey, everyone in America loves
   doughnuts, even Homer Simpson. At Mad Over Donuts ,  Mumbai, they
   clearly share the love, serving ringed donuts and filled donuts and
   iced donuts, with kitschy names like Nutty Buddy and Mamma Mia.
   Mad Over Donuts, 63, Bhulabhai Desai Marg, Breach Candy, Mumbai.
   Tel: 022 3211 0000 (Plus three other locations in Mumbai, and two in
   Delhi)
   Louisiana Cajun
   In New Orleans, Cajun is king. The seasoned, spiced, hearty meals of
   rice and game and fish go down real smooth with jazz. India’s
   well-versed on spice, so Arthur’s Theme , Pune, does a pretty good
   imitation of Down South jalapeno and cheese poppers, fish with cayenne
   pepper, fish croquettes, and chicken marinated in Cajun sauce with
   ailioli.
   Arthur’s Theme, 2,Vrindawan Apartment,Lane No 6, North Main Road,
   Koregaon Park, Pune.
   Tel: 020 26132710
   Wood-Fired Oven New York Pizza
   You can’t get a real Chicago-style pizza outside the Windy City. But
   you can get a damn good replication of its cousin, the thin-crust
   wood-fired oven pizza, at La Terrasse, Pondicherry. The simple
   semi-open-air joint has pizzas with every kind of cheese imaginable and
   toppings like pineapple that will truly melt between oven and your
   mouth.
   La Terrasse, No 5, Near Beach Corner, Subbiah Street, Puducherry Ho,
   Pondicherry.
   Tel: 413 2220809
   The California Maki Roll
   When Japanese Sushi chefs flocked to LA in the 60s to make their
   fortunes, their experiments brought the inside-out California roll into
   existence. Containing cucumber, avocado and crab meat or imitation crab
   stick, and an outer layer of rice, it’s the perfect starter for the
   uninitiated. And at Harima, Bangalore, their Japanese chef got the
   California roll just right.
   Harima, 131, Devatha Plaza, Residency Road, Bangalore.
   Tel: 080 41325757
   Tex Mex Fajitas
   In the southwest US, Spanish colonial settlers, Native Americans and
   Mexicans brought mouth-watering fajitas across the border. The dish of
   grilled meat served on a flour or corn tortilla, with added veggies,
   sour crème, and guacamole can be found in all its glory at the Rodeo
   Bar, New Delhi, along with mock saddles for seats and
   cowboy-hat-wearing waiters.
   Rodeo Bar, 12A, Connaught Place, New Delhi.
   Tel: 011 23354859
   American Vegetarian
   Vegetarians exist in the US, believe it or not. And it’s clear that
   Bean Me Up , Anjuna-Vagator, Goa, was started by an expat American. It
   gives you the whole range of substitute meats:  Tofu, seitan, and
   tempeh, the organic salads Californians love, vegan cakes and pies, and
   of course soyabean, which the place does justice to with soya whipped
   cream and even soysage! You can almost pretend you’re at Portland’s
   hippest new vegan café.
   Bean Me Up, 1639 Deulvaddo, Anjuna-Vagator, Goa.
   Tel: 0832 2273479
   Seattle Coffee and Cakes
   Seattle is known for two things: rock music and coffee. After all, it’s
   the place Starbuck’s was born. In this town, coffee is a religion. And
   just like chai goes with biscuits, American coffee must be accompanied
   by a muffin or cake. At Moonpeak Espresso, McLeodganj, Himachal
   Pradesh, you can get just that: A slice of Seattle with your Tibetan
   meditation.
   Moonpeak Espresso, Temple Road, McLeod Ganj, Himachal Pradesh.
   Fried Chicken
   Don’t go to KFC, I beg you. The breaded mixture or batter for fried
   chicken is something you have to get just right. And at Apple Bee Inn ,
   Uttarakhand, they get it. May be it’s influence of people like Tom
   Alter’s parents, American missionaries long settled in the area. Or may
   be that it’s not a fast food joint. It’s a good thing the restaurant
   doubles as a hotel; proper fried chicken has a tendency of weighing you
   down, and you’ll want to sprawl out on your bed after gorging.
   Apple Bee Inn, Village Masrana, Dhanaulty Road, Mussoorie, Uttarakhand.
   Tel: 0135 2115290
   The Health Food Craze
   After McDonald’s, health food became obese America’s new obsession. At
   Eco-nut , Kodaikanal, in this town founded by Americans, you can find
   every variation of US dieting made delicious: Granola-y cereal, dried
   fruits and seed mixes, and even home-made yoghurt. Eat up and you’ll be
   ready to master Kodi’s hills.
   Eco-nut, PT Road, Kodaikanal, Tamil Nadu.
   Tel:  04542 43296
   American Style Burger
   Since the time the cheeseburger originated in Pasadena, California, a
   true American burger has evolved to include the works: Pickles,
   tomatoes, onions, lettuce, bacon, sauces, and ... that’s just the
   start. At Café 0294 , Udaipur, they’ve just got lettuce and tomato but
   the meat patty is juicy and the buns are soft.
   Café 0294, Hotel Raja Place, Burman Chambers, UIT Bridge, Saheli Marg.
   Udaipur, Rajasthan.
   Tel: 0294 25600400
   Elvis Presley’s Peanut Butter and Banana Sandwich
   Elvis may not have invented the sandwich, but this was his favourite
   snack. Him, and most American kids, who wolf them down as an
   after-school snack. And at Peace, Puri, they’ve figured out the perfect
   ratio of spread to banana.
   Peace Restaurant, Chakratirtha Road, Puri, Orissa.
   Thanksgiving Dinner — Turkey, Cranberry and the Works
   Arguably the most American of meals, it has its origins with the first
   European settlers and their feasts with Native Americans.  Every
   holiday season, Le Brasserie, Le Meridien, Bangalore , serves up an
   authentic imported Butterball Turkey and cranberry sauce. If only they
   had American football on big screen TVs, and cousins, and drunk uncles,
   and the Macy’s Day Parade... well, maybe food can’t get rid of all
   homesickness.
   Le Brasserie, Le Meridien Hotel, PB No 174, 28, Sankey Road, Bangalore,
   Karnataka.
   Tel: 080 22262233

       For thin crust wood fired pizza, I would like to add "Mediterraneo"
       at Khajuraho, MP. It serves one of the best foreign food in the
       country.
