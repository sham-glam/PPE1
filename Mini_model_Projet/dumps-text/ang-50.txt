   They say serendipity is often the most wonderful way of things coming
   to be. In the case of chef Meherwan Irani, the founder of ‘Chai Pani’
   in Asheville, USA, it was a vision that he had in the middle of the
   night.

   The year was 1990, and the young boy of 20, from Ahmednagar,
   Maharashtra, decided to move to the United States for his MBA degree.
   Before moving continents, however, Meherwan wanted to satisfy his
   craving for Indian street food one last time, as he knew he would
   dearly miss it when he made the transition.

   So he went all out and gorged on the papdi chaat and bhel he could
   possibly find. Street food, you see, was Meherwan’s weakness, and he
   couldn’t bear the thought of leaving it all behind. But, as this
   world-famous chef tells The Better India, life has a funny way of
   things working out.

‘I woke up in the middle of the night and had an entire plan charted out.’

   During his MBA, Meherwan met his soon-to-be wife Molly, while she was
   waiting tables at her parents’ restaurant in Myrtle Beach, South
   Carolina. It was love at first sight, and the duo soon went on to get
   married and have a child.

   In 2005, the family moved to Asheville, where Meherwan was with Lexus
   and Mercedes-Benz in management positions. Life was good and he was
   content.

   But, things were soon about to change.

   As the year 2009 dawned, it brought with it crises in the United
   States. The workforce was reeling from the catastrophic effects of the
   economic meltdown, coupled with a deep recession.

   Like every employee in the country, Meherwan was fearful. One night
   during these troubled times, he woke up with a plan.

   “I was desperate for a viable career switch. It was the middle of the
   night and I just seemed to have the vision for my future restaurant,
   Chai Pani, all planned out in my head.”

   The idea, he says, was a simple one — to introduce America to the
   Indian street food that he had grown up eating and loving. However, for
   a corporate employee to shift professions wasn’t an easy task. But he
   found support in his wife Molly.

   “Despite not having much professional culinary experience, Molly and I
   put together a profitable business plan that very night,” he recounts.
   “The next day, we took this plan to banks, private lenders, and credit
   unions.”

   But, times were tough and no one wanted to support a new venture built
   on a “high-risk and far-fetched idea”. The couple was turned down by
   everyone they approached. But if Meherwan had learnt anything, it is
   that when everything goes south, believing in the dream is what makes
   it come true.

Funding the cooking business with love

   “Molly and I wrote an open letter to family and friends and shared both
   our hearts as well as our wild idea. We knew we weren’t presenting an
   amazing investment but we really believed in our plan, and the money
   started to come — from friends, from family, from strangers,” says
   Meherwan.

   In the span of 45 days, love started pouring in and the couple managed
   to raise $75,000. In 2009, Chai Pani saw the light of day with a menu
   that had what Meherwan terms the “most democratic, egalitarian,
   approachable, affordable, and pan-Indian cuisine of India” — chaat.

   As people from in and around Asheville began frequenting the place, the
   popularity of the dishes grew. Meherwan was amazed at how loved Indian
   street food really was. So, in 2013, having tasted immense success in
   the first branch of the restaurant, he opened another branch in
   Atlanta.

   So loved was Chai Pani that it went on to win the 2022 James Beard
   Award for America’s ‘Outstanding Restaurant’.

   This, says the chef, was a memorable moment.

   He adds, “When I won the award for outstanding restaurant, it meant so
   much more than if I’d won just as a chef. This is because the award
   acknowledges everyone who works to make a restaurant exist.”

   Rightly so, for anyone who stops by Chai Pani, a fascinating sight
   beholds them. Crowds swell as people wait to get a seat at the
   restaurant, which is filled with the aromas of keema, chicken tikka,
   uttapams, and more.

   And standing proud at the door, you’ll find 52-year-old Meherwan, ready
   to welcome more guests and treat them to his specialities. “Today, in
   retrospect,” he says, “taking the leap into unfamiliar territory and
   starting my own venture is one of the best things I have ever done.”

Reminiscing India in every bite

   As part of Chai Pani’s menu, there are Indian snacks and food you’d
   typically find on the streets here, being sold at affordable prices.
   What sets them apart is that they incorporate the true taste of India,
   with their desi tadkas.

   While the sev batata dahi puri and vada pav have a fan following of
   their own, the most popular dish, as you may have guessed, is the pani
   puri. Queues wait their turn to have the golgappas drenched in the
   spicy and sweet chutneys.

   And this makes the chef’s day. “I felt Indian street food was one of
   the most underrepresented foods in Western culture. Diners craved the
   stereotype-shattering food, drinks and service of Chai Pani, and this
   crafted our success story.”

   He adds that guests have often told him how the restaurant is
   recognised as “sparking a revolution in Indian cuisine in America”. He
   now feels the circle is complete, as this is the aim he set out with.

   “I want to show our guests that Indian food is so much more diverse,
   interesting, unexpected, and personal than a handful of regional
   cuisines that have been popularised so far,” he says. “To me, there is
   no other food that captures the essence of India like street food —
   chaotic, colourful, innovative, vibrant, joyful, complex, and of
   course, delicious.”

   So while, street food lovers gorge on tangy, crunchy, spicy bhel puri
   or satisfy their sweet cravings with a dahi puri or the humble aloo
   tikki chaat, the menu also caters to non-veg aficionados. There’s keema
   pav, chicken tikka, and even some quirky dishes such as kale pakoras
   and matchstick okra fries.

   The prices of the dishes range from $9 to upto $18 and are described as
   “incredibly over the top delicious” by guests. Reviews also read that
   the food is “every minute worth the wait”. Chai Pani serves around
   1,000 customers on a busy day, and guests advise to “reach on time if
   you want to get a space to sit”.

   But curating a successful venture hasn’t been easy.

   “Opening the restaurant in a recession taught us how to make do with
   less and create a menu that was affordable and smartly developed,” says
   Meherwan, pointing to the challenges he came across while starting.
   “Our strategy helped keep our cost of goods down while also using
   high-quality ingredients.”

   What worked most for them was staying authentic, according to Chef
   Irani. “We ensured that we stayed true to the concept of Indian street
   food, which is meant to be affordable and approachable to everybody.”

   “I’m so proud that Indian food and specifically street food is being
   recognised on a national and global level.”
