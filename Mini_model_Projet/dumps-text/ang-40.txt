Global Eats: The Rise of Indian Street Food

       Global Eats: The Rise of Indian Street Food

The flavors and ingredients of the street-food stalls found throughout India
are making their way onto U.S. restaurant menus.
       The vast culinary landscape of Indian street food is expanding
       throughout the United States in a variety of forms, from kati rolls
       and dosas to various spicy, flavorful snacks known as chaat.
       Americans have been building up an appetite for these foods, says
       Akash Kapoor, founder and CEO of Curry Up Now, the San Francisco
       restaurant chain that is adapting Indian foods in familiar forms
       such as burritos and also is offering traditional Indian
       street-food snacks. “What was once described as exotic is now a
       commonplace food, and overall there’s been a greater acceptance of
       ethnic food,” he says. “There is a homey, comfort factor with
       Indian food, and it intrigues many people because it’s different
       from other cuisines.”
       Indian street food varies widely from region to region, and even
       from vendor to vendor within regions. It can incorporate fried
       dough with or without fillings, is often made with a medley of
       vegetables, spices, and sauces, and can include a range of
       flavorful, seasoned meats. It can take the form of dumpling-like
       creations such as momos served with spicy chili paste, kebabs on or
       off the skewer, and a variety of sandwiches filled with flavors
       that are likely unfamiliar to most U.S. consumers.
       Chaat refers to the Indian street “snacks” that are usually built
       upon a crunchy base and topped with chickpeas, potatoes, onions
       and/or various other ingredients, often served with chutneys or an
       umami sauce called chaat masala.
       Research firm Datassential reports that chaat is listed on only 1.8
       percent of restaurant menus, up 3 percent since 2015 and up 30
       percent since 2009. Only 12 percent of consumers are familiar with
       it, and only 6 percent of consumers report having tried it.
       Chaat has its strongest presence on fine-dining menus, but has
       potential to grow, according to Cassandra Kaul, digital strategist
       at Datassential. “There’s an inherent flexibility to chaat that
       allows for creative takes and safe experimentation,” she says.
       Emerging Concepts
       Restaurant operators seeking to experiment with chaat or other
       Indian street foods will find no shortage of ideas emerging from
       the concepts dedicated to these foods that are appearing around the
       country. One such concept is Chaatable, a Memphis, Tenn.,
       restaurant opened last year by acclaimed chef Maneet Chauhan under
       her Morph Hospitality operating company.
       Chauhan, who is also known as a judge on the culinary TV show
       Chopped, says Chaatable strives to offer authentic Indian street
       foods in a vibrant environment that recalls the colorful street
       stalls of her home country. “The U.S. dining market as a whole is
       becoming very sophisticated and global,” she says. “Our guests at
       our other Nashville concepts let us know they were ready to try
       something beyond chicken tikka masala.”
       In developing the menu, Chauhan says she sought to “cover the major
       [protein] categories,” while giving customers an authentic Indian
       street-food experience. “At the end of the day we stayed authentic
       and true to traditional Indian street food because we knew it’s
       what customers wanted,” she says.
       The menu pulls flavors and ingredients from various Indian regions
       and is as fun and whimsical as the decor. Dishes include O.M. Ghee
       (ghee toasted cashews, curry leaves, and chaat masala) and Frankie
       Goes to Bollywood—a malai chicken or paneer parantha frankie (a
       type of wrap common in Mumbai), served with onion, tomato, and mint
       chutney. The best sellers on the menu have been the Build-a-Bhel (a
       puffed rice dish with choice of ingredients), Butter Chicken, and
       Samosas, says Chauhan.
       Some Indian street foods were deemed a little too eccentric for
       U.S. palates, however. Chauhan opted not to include bheja fry, for
       example, which is made with sautéed goat’s brain. “We thought that
       would be pushing the envelope a bit too much,” she says.
       Saucy and Spicy
       At Curry Up Now, which operates three food trucks and six
       company-owned restaurants (and recently began franchising as well),
       Kapoor seeks to infuse the menu with spice in more ways than one.
       “We didn’t want to do it the way it’s always been done,” he says.
       “We wanted to be sexy, naughty, and risqué while keeping the food
       authentic.”
       Menu items include Sexy Fries, which feature Curry Up Now’s own
       Indian-inspired poutine with cross-cut sweet potato fries, cheese,
       and paneer or chicken tikka masala; and The Naughty Naan, which is
       similar to a flatbread pizza, topped with caramelized onions,
       jalapeño, cheese, and paneer or chicken tikka masala.
       The company, which launched as a food truck in 2009, wanted to
       create its own variety of hand-held Indian street foods. It takes
       the relatively unfamiliar flavors of Indian cuisine and introduces
       them in more familiar hand-held forms such as burritos, tacos,
       quesadillas, pizza, and fries “to make it approachable for the
       everyday American consumer,” says Kapoor.
       The food is spicy, but not so much that it overpowers the dishes,
       he explains. “It’s spice-forward, but not ‘kick you in your gut’
       spicy. Spice doesn’t have to mean red chili powder that burns.
       Coriander, cumin, asafetida, turmeric, fennel, allspice, cloves,
       chili powder, etc., are all spices that we use in our food.”
       In addition to the burritos and bowls, the street-snack portion of
       the menu also generates a lot of consumer interest. These include a
       giant samosa known as ‘The Dude,” which is filled with chicken
       biryani and a sous-vide egg. Other items include Vada Pav, which is
       a slider-style sandwich common on the streets of Mumbai, and Pav
       Bhaji, a vegetable mash served with pav bread (an Indian bread
       roll).
       Curry Up Now’s burritos are made with a layer of rice on the
       tortilla, topped with chana garbanzo masala and a choice of
       protein, such as chicken tikka masala, ghee makhni butter paneer,
       or lamb. Kapoor says his personal favorite is the Hella Vegan
       burrito, which is a samosa inside a tortilla, and made like samosa
       chaat.
       The company’s Deconstructed Samosa is another popular item, made
       using the crispy skin of a traditional samosa, topped with layers
       of chana garbanzo masala, pico kachumber (an Indian salad made with
       cucumber and tomato), chutneys, mini samosas, and a choice of
       protein. “It’s a reimagined version of a traditional Indian street
       food, but with added layers and deeper flavor from the toppings,”
       says Kapoor, who describes it as a “party in your mouth
       experience.”
       Bridging the Gap
       In New York City, Deep Foods is bridging the gap between
       traditional Indian foods and consumer interest in Indian street
       foods at its restaurants. The company operates five Deep Indian
       Kitchen restaurant locations, all in Manhattan.
       “We are having tremendous success with the concept we are
       offering,” says Deepak Amin, president and CEO of Deep Foods, which
       is based in Union, N.J., and also operates a large CPG business
       supplying retail stores with Indian foods (see sidebar, p. 57). He
       says consumers are seeking flavorful foods in grab-and-go forms,
       whether it’s from food trucks or restaurants.
       The menu at Deep Indian Kitchen is divided into two parts, with the
       traditional Indian foods making up one portion of the offerings and
       the grab-and-go items the other. Both sides have been equally
       popular, Amin says.
       Among the grab-and-go items are kati rolls—which many people are
       already familiar with from Indian street cars in New York, along
       with dosa, which is a rice-based crepe that also happens to be
       gluten-free. Samosas, which often appear as an appetizer on Indian
       restaurant menus in the U.S., are also a popular grab-and-go food
       at the Deep Indian Kitchen restaurants, Amin says.
       The restaurants drive a strong lunch business, and aim to target
       “adventurous eaters,” generally in the 45-and-under age group, he
       adds.
       Deep Indian Kitchen is currently exploring the idea of adding a
       breakfast menu. “The cuisine has a lot of different [breakfast]
       options,” says Amin. “We are looking at what we can do with grab
       and go for breakfast.”
       Deep is also exploring opportunities to add more locations in New
       York City, and has a flagship restaurant under construction on its
       headquarters campus in New Jersey.

       Retail Products Target Grab-and-Go Snackers
       Anshu Dua, co-founder and CEO of The Chaat Co., New York, is
       seeking to create the Sabra of Indian street foods.
       The startup is launching its products, a line of fresh Indian snack
       packs, into a limited number of retail stores, including some Whole
       Foods Market locations in the Northeast, and into some college and
       corporate foodservice grab-and-go retail displays. “When you look
       at what Sabra did with Middle Eastern and Mediterranean foods like
       hummus, babaganoush, etc., they basically took very ethnic foods
       and flavors and snack-ified them,” Dua says. “Twelve years ago,
       Americans had no clue what hummus was.”
       The Chaat Co.’s new snack-pack line includes popped chickpea chips
       with chaat masala, along with a variety of different Indian
       chutneys—tamarind, mango, coconut, and tomato. “These are inspired
       by flavors from different parts of India,” Dua says, noting that
       mango and tamarind are flavors typically used in northern India,
       while tomato reflects southern Indian cuisine.
       “You will find these chutneys as condiments for a variety of
       different types of street food in India,” says Dua. “We tried to
       capture many of the ingredients and the flavors from that, and
       created a snacking experience for Americans so they can experience
       Indian food like they never had before and in a whole new way
       versus the typical buffet line experience that most Americans have
       today.”
       Dua says the Indian foods many Americans have become familiar with
       through traditional, sit-down Indian restaurants were developed by
       an older generation of Indian entrepreneurs who were seeking to
       create menus that appealed to Indian-Americans with the comfort
       foods of their homeland.
       Now, he says, Indian food producers like himself are targeting a
       younger generation of consumers who enjoy experimenting with new
       flavors, and also enjoy snacking and sharing foods.
       Likewise, Deepak Amin, president and CEO of Union, N.J.-based Deep
       Foods, parent of the Tandoor Chef line of frozen Indian foods and
       the Deep Indian Kitchen restaurant chain in New York, says Deep
       Foods is looking to bring back more hand-held Indian street foods
       into its product line. “It’s all about grab-and-go items, and items
       that are full of flavor,” he says.
       The company is in the process of transitioning all its products to
       the Deep Indian Kitchen brand, which it has previously used for
       authentic foods targeting the Indian consumer market. “We are going
       back to our roots and offering all the different products we have
       under one umbrella,” says Amin. “As awareness is growing, we are
       seeing that all of the other [traditional Indian] offerings we have
       are becoming more relevant.” -- M.H.
