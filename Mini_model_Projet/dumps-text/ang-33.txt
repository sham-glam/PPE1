   If I were to describe Indian street food with just one word, it would
   be “colorful”. It’s an assault on the senses in the best ways possible.

   India is a vast country boasting a diverse array of regional cuisines.
   Historically, it’s been known to produce up to 75% of the world’s
   spices, leading to some of the tastiest and most interesting dishes
   you’ll find anywhere on the planet.

   I’ve been a fan of Indian food for most of my adult life, but it wasn’t
   until my trip to India that I was exposed to the magical realm of
   Indian street food. There is so much interesting street food to be
   experienced in this country, many of which I had never seen anywhere
   else. From puchkas to kathi rolls to paan and jalebi, every turn led me
   to something new and delicious to tantalize both my eyes and my taste
   buds.

   I went to India looking for curry but what made the biggest impression
   was the street food. If you’re planning a trip to India and have a

THE BEST INDIAN STREET FOODS

    1. What is Indian Street Food?
    2. Tips for Eating Street Food in India
    3. 30 Must-Try Indian Street Foods
    4. Popular Cities for Street Food in India

WHAT IS INDIAN STREET FOOD?

   In some countries like Japan, street food is limited. Not so in India.
   Indian street food is as diverse and plentiful as Indian cuisine. Every
   region has its own specialties with city vendors offering hundreds if
   not thousands of different options.

   The history of street food in India isn’t well documented, but it’s
   widely believed that its origins can be traced back to the time when
   the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan moved his capital from Agra to Delhi.
   Chaat, the most popular type of Indian street food, was first
   introduced to Old Delhi during that time. It became popular as a
   mid-day snack after cooks from Varanasi were invited to set up shop in
   Delhi by officials of the Mughal Dynasty.

   Today, street food has become an important part of Indian culture and
   has taken root in every part of the country. Its affordability makes it
   accessible to everyone. Aside from chaat, other popular varieties of
   Indian street food include kebabs, biryani, korma, and kulfi.

TIPS FOR EATING STREET FOOD IN INDIA

   Have you heard of “Delhi belly”? It’s the term for traveler’s diarrhea
   in india. It’s very much a real thing and something you should be
   concerned about when eating the street food in India. I was aware of it
   and tried my best not to catch it, but I still suffered a bout of
   diarrhea in Mumbai, probably from street vendor ice cream.

   As tempting as it is to try every Indian street food dish that catches
   your eye, it’s best to exercise caution as you don’t want a
   debilitating case of the runs ruining your trip to India. Here are a
   few pointers to remember when eating street food in India.
    1. Look for popular street food stalls.  The more customers a stall
       has, the better and safer it’s food is likely to be.
    2. Avoid dishes and drinks made with water.  Unfiltered water is the
       main culprit for Delhi belly so avoid anything made with
       undistilled water like ice cubes, fresh fruit juices, and sauces.
       The same goes for produce washed in tap water.  If you can, find
       street food stalls that prepare their food using distilled water.
    3. Fried or grilled dishes are safer.  Heat kills bacteria so fried or
       grilled dishes are typically safer to eat.  The same goes for
       drinks.  Hot drinks like chai tea are generally safer because
       they’re made with boiled water.
    4. Avoid meat dishes.  Stay away from meat dishes if you can because
       you don’t know how long they’ve been sitting out.
    5. Go on a street food tour.  As a foreigner, it’s difficult to know
       for sure which street food stalls are safe.  For peace of mind, I
       highly recommend going on a street food tour in India.  A
       knowledgeable guide will take you to the city’s best and safest
       street food stalls so all you have to worry about is how much you
       can eat. Check out Get Your Guide for a list of food tours in
       Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and other cities in India.

30 MUST-TRY INDIAN STREET FOODS & DRINKS

1. Nimbu Masala Soda

   I went on a food tour in Mumbai and the first place we went to was a
   stall selling nimbu masala soda. According to my guide, it was a great
   way of prepping our stomachs for the many street food dishes we were
   about to have.

   Nimbu masala soda is a carbonated drink made with lemon juice and soda
   water mixed with chaat masala (a spice mix), cumin, and kala namak
   (black salt). It’s a tasty and intriguing blend of sweet, sour, spicy,
   and savory that you’d never expect from a drink.

   Nimbu masala soda is popular throughout India where it goes by many
   names like banta soda, goli soda, goti soda, and fotash jawl. It’s
   especially popular in North India and Delhi where it’s enjoyed as a
   summer cooler and referred to as “Delhi’s local drink”.

   I had it in Delhi as well on a food tour, but towards the end of our
   tour, perhaps to aid in digestion.

2. Masala Chai

   If you’re a frequent customer at Starbucks, then you’ve probably heard
   of chai tea. Widely consumed throughout India and South Asia, it’s a
   tea beverage of Indian origin that’s become a staple at cafe and
   teahouse menus around the world.

   Recipes for masala chai vary but it’s typically made by boiling a
   strong black tea like Assam tea in a buffalo milk and water mixture.
   It’s brewed with a spice mix called karha which is made using a base of
   ground ginger and cardamom pods. Depending on the person making it,
   other spices can be added to the karha mixture like cinnamon, nutmeg,
   cloves, peppercorn, star anise, and fennel seeds.

   Masala chai is a staple drink in Indian households and often sold at
   roadside stalls throughout the country. When enjoyed at home, it’s
   usually consumed in the morning with breakfast, or offered to guests as
   a sign of hospitality. It’s a warming drink that can be enjoyed as is
   or sweetened with sugar, syrup, honey, or jaggery.

3. Lassi

   Other than chai tea, lassi is perhaps the most internationally
   well-known drink of Indian origin. It refers to a probiotic drink made
   with a blend of dahi (yogurt), water, and spices.

   Lassi is traditionally made with yogurt and water and can be either
   salty or sweet. Sweet versions of lassi are typically flavored with
   sugar, rosewater, or different types of blended fruit like mango,
   lemon, strawberry, and other fruit juices. It’s a refreshingly sweet
   and tart drink that’s similar in consistency to a milkshake.

   Lassi is especially popular in the northern parts of India.
   Interestingly, some regions like Rajasthan and Gujarat flavor lassi
   with saffron, while cannabis-infused versions called “bhang” are often
   consumed during festivals like Holi and Maha Shivaratri. Leaves from
   the cannabis plant are ground into a paste and mixed into the lassi.

   In an India episode of No Reservations, the late great Anthony Bourdain
   was taken to a licensed bhang shop in Rajasthan where he was offered
   five types of bhang lassi – baby lassi, medium, normal strong, super
   duper sexy strong, and “full power, 24 hour, no toilet, no shower”. My
   man went with the full power. Ha!

   Pictured below are traditional lassis served in clay pots. After
   serving, the clay pots are broken and then recycled to create new pots.

   Can you guess what type of lassi this is? It’s a mug of sweet lassi
   flavored with pomegranate. Not quite super duper sexy strong but very
   good and highly addictive nonetheless.

4. Masala Chana Dal Chaat

   Chaat is the most popular type of Indian street food. The term refers
   to a family of savory Indian snacks, some of the most popular being
   samosas, kachori, dahi vadas, vada pav, and pav bhaji.

   To be honest, I find the concept of chaat confusing because the dishes
   can sometimes look so different. Based on its definition, it refers to
   Indian street foods made with a crisp starchy base like fried dough or
   crispy puffed rice. There are many different types of chaat made with a
   variety of additional ingredients, but the common denominator is the
   crisp starchy base.

   That’s the definition, but I still don’t completely understand it
   because some dishes that are categorized as chaat don’t seem to fit the
   description. In any case, I think the concept of chaat – like the side
   head nod – is something that only locals can fully grasp.

   Pictured below is a type of chaat made with chana dal (split baby
   chickpeas) mixed with chaat masala and other ingredients like peanuts,
   chopped onion, coriander, and lime. It reminded me of an Indian version
   of trail mix, but much more interesting and flavorful.

5. Aloo Chana Chaat

   Aloo means “potato” so you can probably guess what type of chaat this
   is by its name. Its made with split baby chickpeas (chana) and fried or
   boiled potatoes flavored with spices, chutney, and other ingredients.
   If it’s made with yogurt (dahi), then it’s called dahi aloo chana
   chaat.

   Like the chana dal chaat, it’s a fun Indian street food snack that goes
   very well with beer. In fact, both of these stalls were located side by
   side in Kolkata, just outside a liquor store. Location is everything.

6. Bhel Puri

   Bhel puri (or bhelpuri) is a type of chaat made with crunchy puffed
   rice, sev (fried chickpea noodles), puri, chana dal, vegetables, and
   spices. It’s strongly associated with the beaches of Mumbai, like
   Chowpatty, where it’s often enjoyed and referred to as a “beach snack”.

   Bhel puri can be served either wet (gaela bhel) or dry (sukha bel). Wet
   bhel puri is made with the addition of chutneys like tamarind chutney
   or green coriander chutney, but the base ingredients remain the same.
   It’s a crunchy and fun snack with an interesting mix of savory, sweet,
   sour, and spicy flavors.

7. Jhalmuri

   Jhalmuri is a spicy and tangy version of bhel puri that’s popular in
   Kolkata and West Bengal. Jhal means “spicy” while muri refers to the
   puffed rice.

   Like bhel puri, jhalmuri is made with puffed rice and a mix of
   ingredients like sev, roasted peanuts, tomatoes, onions, lemon juice,
   herbs, and spices. What makes jhalmuri special is the addition of
   mustard oil which gives the snack its characteristic spicy and pungent
   flavor.

8. Poha

   Poha refers to flattened or beaten rice. It can be used to refer to
   both the ingredient and the Indian dishes made with it. It’s a popular
   Indian breakfast staple that’s also commonly sold as street food.

   To prepare, rice is parboiled and then flattened, resulting in crispy
   thin flakes that can be consumed with little to no cooking. They can be
   eaten raw after a bit of soaking or fried and roasted with other
   ingredients. Poha is popular throughout India where it’s known by many
   names like avalakki, paunva, poya, pauwa, and aval.

   There are many Indian dishes made with poha but one of the most
   well-known is Indori poha with jalebi. It’s a beloved breakfast and
   street food dish from Indore made with poha, jalebi, sev, onions, and
   fennel seeds.

9. Pani Puri / Puchka / Gol Gappa

   Pani puri is one of the most interesting street foods I had in India.
   It refers to a popular type of chaat made with crispy hollow balls
   called puri. Preparations vary by region but they’re typically filled
   with a mixture of flavored water, tamarind chutney, mint chutney, chaat
   masala, green chili, onions, chickpeas, and potato mash. It’s popular
   throughout India where it goes by different names like puchka, gol
   gappa, fulki, pakodi, and gup chup.

   Aside from its interesting mix of sweet, spicy, and sour flavors, what
   make pani puri so interesting is how it’s prepared. The top of the puri
   is punctured and filled with the spice mixture before the whole thing
   is dunked in tamarind water. The puri is delicate, like a potato chip,
   so you’re instructed to eat the pani puri whole before it
   disintegrates. The vendor will keep filling puri arter puri until you
   tell him to stop.

   According to my guides, pani puri is especially popular with Indian
   women, many of whom are known to consume over twenty pani puris in one
   sitting. They’re like little flavor bombs on your taste buds and
   something that you absolutely need to try in India.

   With that said, be careful where you eat pani puri because they’re made
   with water. For that reason, I recommend trying them on a food tour.

10. Dahi Vada

   Dahi vada is a type of chaat made by soaking vadas in a thick yogurt
   sauce. Vadas are soft lentil fritters while dahi refers to yogurt, so
   the name dahi vadas literally means “fritters soaked in yogurt”. It’s a
   popular Indian festival dish that’s also commonly sold as street food.

   To prepare, urad lentils are soaked overnight and ground into a batter
   before being deep-fried. They’re then soaked in water and drained
   before being covered in a thick beaten yogurt sauce. Before serving,
   they’re usually topped with green coriander chutney, tamarind chutney,
   and a host of spices and garnishes like cumin, chili powder, chaat
   masala, and pomegranate seeds. Creamy, tangy, and sweet, the vadas have
   an interesting texture that’s similar to soft fluffy donuts.

   Like many of the dishes in this Indian street food guide, dahi vada is
   popular throughout the country where it goes by different names like
   dahi bhalla, dahi bade, thayir vadai, doi bora, and thairu vada.

11. Kanji Vada

   Kanji vada is a traditional Rajasthani street food dish made with vadas
   soaked in mustard-flavored fermented water called kanji or rai ka
   paani. The vadas are made from a combination of moong dal and urad dal
   flavored with green chili peppers, ginger, and salt. The vadas are left
   to soak in the kanji for several minutes before serving to absorb its
   mustardy flavor.

   During the Holi festival, a special type of kanji vadas is prepared
   using chakundar kanji. Chakundar kanji is a type of kanji made with
   fermented beetroot and carrots that give the liquid a rich red color.

12. Kachori

   Kachori is a type of chaat made with deep-fried breads. It’s popular
   throughout India where it goes by many names like kachauri, katchuri,
   and kachodi.

   You can’t tell from this picture but the kachori itself is shaped like
   a round flattened ball (similar to aloo tikki) filled with a stuffing.
   Depending on where it’s from, fillings can vary but common stuffing
   ingredients include yellow moong dal, urad dal, besan (gram flour),
   black pepper, chili powder, cumin, and other spices. From what I
   understand, kachori is usually savory but it can also be sweet.

   Kachori can be eaten on its own or in this case, drenched in gravy. I
   had this version from a stall in Chandni Chowk that was smothered in
   aloo ki sabzi, which is a type of spicy potato curry. According to my
   guide, this stall is known for serving some of the best kachori in
   Delhi.

13. Aloo Tikki

   Aloo tikki is a type of Indian fritter made with deep-fried mashed
   potatoes. Aloo means “potato” while tikki refers to a small cutlet or
   croquette. You can think of aloo tikki as the Indian version of hash
   browns.

   Aloo tikki can be made with or without a stuffing. To prepare, boiled
   potatoes are mashed and formed into patties before being filled with
   ingredients like coriander, peas, chana dal, and different herbs and
   spices. The patties are then deep-fried and served with a sauce like
   tamarind chutney, green coriander chutney, tomato chutney, or dahi.

14. Samosa

   Samosa is one of the most popular dishes in Indian cuisine. It’s widely
   available throughout India as street food or as an appetizer or snack
   at restaurants, cafes, and gatherings.

   Samosa refers to a pastry filled with savory ingredients like potatoes,
   peas, onions, lentils, meat, herbs, and spices. It’s often shaped like
   a triangle or pyramid but it can take other forms as well depending on
   where it’s made. Samosas can be baked or fried and often served with
   tamarind chutney or green coriander chutney.

   I’ve always associated samosas with Indian cuisine so it was
   interesting to learn that it may not be an Indian dish after all, at
   least not originally. It’s believed to have originated in the Middle
   East sometime in the 10th century and was brought to India by merchants
   who enjoyed it as an easy on-the-go snack. It’s earliest mention was in
   the Iranian history book Tarikh-i Bayhaqi, where it was referred to as
   “sambosa”.

   Samosa may not be Indian in origin but it’s very much a part of Indian
   cuisine now. It’s also popular in other parts of South Asia, the Middle
   East, Southeast Asia, Western Asia, the Mediterranean, and Africa.

15. Pakora

   Pakora refers to a type of spiced fritter made with a variety of
   ingredients, usually vegetables, coated in seasoned gram flour batter
   and then deep-fried. They’re usually eaten as a snack or appetizer with
   tamarind sauce, chutney, or raita.

   Some of the most common ingredients used to make pakoras include
   onions, potatoes, plantains, paneer (Indian cottage cheese), and green
   chilies, though they can be made with animal proteins like meat and
   fish as well.

   Enjoyed in countries throughout South Asia like India, Pakistan, Sri
   Lanka, Nepal, and Bangladesh, it’s a tasty and crunchy snack that goes
   by different names like bhajia, bhaji, pakoda, or bora.

16. Dosa

   Dosas are thin rice and lentil crepes made from ground and fermented
   lentil-rice batter. It’s become popular throughout the Indian
   subcontinent but it’s a well-known South Indian dish that’s commonly
   eaten for breakfast or as a snack.

   To prepare, lentils and rice are soaked for several hours before being
   ground separately to a fine consistency. They’re then seasoned with
   salt and allowed to ferment overnight. When ready, the batter is poured
   onto a cast-iron pan or skillet and cooked like a crepe till golden
   brown and crispy.

   There are many types of dosa. They can be eaten plain or stuffed with a
   filling made from vegetables, potatoes, and spices. Pictured below is
   one of the most common types of dosa called masala dosa. It’s made with
   potato masala and served with different sides like chutney and sambar
   (lentil-based vegetable curry).

17. Paratha

   Paratha is a crisp and chewy Indian flatbread made with whole wheat
   flour. It’s popular throughout the Indian subcontinent where it’s
   typically eaten for breakfast or as a snack with various side dishes
   like chutneys, yogurt, and pickled vegetables.

   The process for making parathas is similar to laminated dough. Whole
   wheat dough is rolled and folded multiple times while being layered
   with ghee before being pan-fried. It can be served plain of filled with
   various ingredients like potato, vegetables, and paneer.

   Unlike other types of Indian flatbread like roti or naan which are
   typically consumed as a side dish to curries, paratha is often enjoyed
   as a standalone dish.

18. Pav Bhaji

   Pav bhaji was one of my favorite street foods in India. It’s a simple
   dish but it’s comforting and absolutely delicious.

   Pav bhaji is originally from Mumbai where it was invented as a quick
   lunchtime dish for the city’s textile mill workers in the 1850s. The
   dish caught on and started appearing on restaurant menus in Mumbai and
   throughout the country.

   Pav bhaji consists of a thick spiced curry made with potatoes and
   vegetables like onions, peas, bell peppers, and tomatoes. The potatoes
   and vegetables are cooked with spices before being mashed and served
   with a soft buttery bread roll. Pav means “bread roll” while bhaji
   refers to vegetables or vegetable-based dishes.

   Together with vada pav, pav bhaji is one of the most popular street
   foods in Mumbai. I suggest trying it at Chowpatty or Juhu Beach. It’s
   the perfect dish to snack on while enjoying the view of the ocean.

19. Bombay Sandwich

   As you can probably guess from the name, the Bombay sandwich is a
   popular street food sandwich in Mumbai. It’s a vegetarian sandwich made
   with beetroot, boiled potatoes, onions, tomatoes, bell peppers,
   cucumbers, chaat masala, and mint chutney sandwiched between buttered
   slices of white bread.

   Bombay sandwiches can be made with plain or toasted bread. The
   beautiful specimen pictured below was made by inserting the sandwich in
   a metal clamp and grilling it over charcoal. It was then cut into
   portions and drizzled with ketchup before serving. Delicious!

20. Vada Pav

   Like pav bhaji, vada pav is one of the most popular street foods in
   Mumbai. You can think of it as an Indian vegetarian slider made with
   deep-fried mashed potato fritters (batata vada) served in a soft bread
   roll.

   To prepare, boiled potatoes are mashed and mixed with garlic, green
   chili peppers, mustard seeds, and spices. The seasoned mash is then
   shaped into a ball and dipped in besan flour before being deep-fried
   and served in a bread roll with fried green chilies and one or more
   chutneys (garlic chutney, mint chutney, tomato chutney, etc).

   Most vada pav sandwiches seem to be made with one large batata vada or
   potato dumpling. This version from a hugely popular stall in Mumbai was
   made with smaller potato fritters for more texture and crunch.

21. Dabeli

   Originally from the Kutch region of Gujarat, dabeli is a type of Indian
   sandwich that looks similar to vada pav. But unlike vada pav which is
   savory, dabeli is more sweet and tangy.

   Dabeli is made with a spice mixture called dabeli masala which consists
   of cumin, cloves, coriander seeds, cinnamon, and red chili peppers.
   It’s mixed into a cooked potato mash and served in a bread roll with
   grated coconut, coriander, pomegranate seeds, sev, onions, roasted
   peanuts, and one or more chutneys.

22. Kathi Roll

   The kathi roll (or kati roll) is a type of wrap that was invented and
   popularized by Nizam’s restaurant in Kolkata. It consists of kebab meat
   wrapped with various vegetables, egg, and chutney in paratha flatbread.

   In its original form, kathi rolls were made only with beef but they’re
   now made with other proteins as well like chicken tikka, mutton, or
   even just vegetables. It’s believed that the kathi roll was created to
   attract British customers. Office commuters didn’t have the time for
   traditional kebab dishes so the kathi roll was invented as a quick and
   portable way of consuming kebabs.

   Kati in Bengali means “stick” and refers to the bamboo skewer used to
   cook the kebabs. It’s an incredibly tasty wrap that’s easy to eat on
   the go.

   Pictured below is the lip-smackingly delicious chicken tikka kathi roll
   from Kusum Rolls in Kolkata. It’s a bit oily on the hands but a real
   joy to the taste buds. Be sure to try their egg rolls and mutton rolls
   as well.

23. Kebab

   The kebab is a hugely popular dish that’s consumed in many parts of the
   world, including India. It refers to grilled meat dishes skewered on
   metal or bamboo sticks. Traditionally, they’re made with mutton or lamb
   but they can be made with other proteins as well like chicken, beef,
   goat, and fish.

   In India, the origin of modern-day kebabs can be traced back to the
   kitchens of the Mughal Empire. Indian kebabs can be made with skewered
   cubed meat (shish kebab) or ground meat (seekh kebab) that’s heavily
   seasoned with Indian spices.

   One of the most well-known types of Indian kebab is the tunde ke kabab
   or buffalo meat galouti kebab from Lucknow. I don’t know how true this
   is, but the original version of this buffalo meat kebab was said to
   have been made with a staggering 160 spices.

24. Bombay Duck Rava Fry

   Bombay duck is a misnomer. It describes a popular Mumbai dish that
   isn’t made with fowl, but fish. Bombay duck refers to Harpadon
   nehereus, a species of lizardfish (no, it isn’t a reptile either) that
   thrives in the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific.

   Also known as bombil, Bombay duck is used in many dishes but one of the
   tastiest has to be Bombay duck rava fry. It’s made by coating bombil
   fillets in a spiced rava (semolina) and rice flour mixture before
   shallow-frying them till crispy and golden brown. Crunchy on the
   outside but soft and buttery on the inside, it’s absolutely delicious.

   Pictured below is a Bombay duck thali (full plate meal) with rice,
   chapati, chutney, and solkhadi, which is a type of curry drink made
   with coconut milk and kokum fruit.

25. Mishti Doi

   Mishti doi is a traditional Bengali dessert made with sweetened
   fermented caramelized dahi (yogurt). Mishti in Bengali means “sweet”
   and doi means “curd”, so mishti doi literally translates to “sweet
   curd”. In Hindi, it’s known as meetha dahi.

   To prepare, milk is boiled until it’s slightly thickened. It’s then
   sweetened with brown sugar or jaggery and allowed to set and ferment
   overnight with curd. No flavorings are usually added though it’s common
   to sneak in just a pinch of cardamom for fragrance.

   Mishti doi is always made in earthenware bowls because the porous walls
   facilitate the evaporation of water and further thickens the yogurt. It
   also allows for the ideal temperature for the growth of the culture.

26. Jalebi

   Jalebi is one of the most common Indian street food desserts. It’s a
   hugely popular snack that’s enjoyed in many parts of India and across
   South Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa.

   This bright orange snack is made from a fermented batter made with
   all-purpose flour and besan flour. The batter is poured in concentric
   circles into hot oil and deep-fried. The fried spirals are then soaked
   in a sugar syrup mixture before serving.

   Jalebi has a crunchy crystalized sugary coating that’s very sweet. It’s
   eaten on its own as a snack or for dessert but it can be paired with
   savory dishes as well. In Indore, it’s commonly eaten with poha for
   breakfast or as a street food dish.

27. Doodhpak

   Doodhpak refers to this delicious Indian dessert pudding from Gujarat.
   It’s made with milk and basmati rice flavored with sugar, saffron,
   cardamom, raisins, pistachios, and almonds. It’s a rich and creamy
   dessert with great texture from the nuts and just the right amount of
   sweetness.

28. Kulfi

   Kulfi refers to a family of frozen Indian desserts. It’s often
   described as traditional Indian ice cream though its consistency is
   denser, like frozen ice cream bars. It’s popular throughout India and
   the rest of the subcontinent.

   Kulfi is made with milk and sugar flavored with fruits, nuts, and
   spices. To prepare, the sweetened and flavored milk is slowly heated
   and thickened before being quickly frozen in tightly sealed molds. This
   fast freezing process produces a smooth ice cream devoid of ice
   crystals. Kulfi comes in many flavors but some of the most traditional
   include mango (pictured below), pistachio, rose, cardamom, and saffron.

   Because kulfi is denser than western ice cream, it takes longer to melt
   which is ideal for India’s scorching climate. This mango kulfi was
   delicious and refreshing and something you’ll probably look for
   everyday in India.

   I went on a street food tour in Delhi and our last stop was this iconic
   stall famous for their stuffed kulfi. It refers to kulfi made from
   fruit pulp which is then stuffed back into the fruit before being
   frozen and set. How they manage to do that I have no idea.

   This is what my mango kulfi looked like before it was sliced up and
   served to me. You can choose from four stuffed kulfi flavors – mango,
   apple, orange, and pomegranate. I wish I could have tried all four.

29. Sancha Ice Cream

   Sancha ice cream is a type of Indian ice cream that gets its name from
   the vessel used to make it – a sancha. The sancha is a hand-powered
   device that was invented in the mid-19th century to allow people to
   make ice cream at home.

   This heritage sancha ice cream shop was the last stop on our Mumbai
   street food tour. We got two flavors – Alphonso mango and custard
   apple. Both were delicious. Unlike kulfi which is frozen, sancha ice
   cream is closer in consistency to a creamy western-style ice cream.

   This bucket filled with rock salt and ice forms part of the sancha. The
   other part is a metal cylinder that goes into this bucket. The cylinder
   is filled with ice cream which is hand-churned as it freezes to keep
   ice crystals from forming.

30. Paan

   Paan (or pan) isn’t really a dish, but more like a digestive or mouth
   freshener. It consists of betel leaf filled with chopped betel (areca)
   nuts and slaked lime to which a plethora of other ingredients like rose
   petal preserves, seeds, nuts, banana syrup, coconut shavings, and
   spices may be added. It’s chewed thoroughly before being spit out or
   swallowed.

   Paan originated in India but it’s widely consumed throughout South
   Asia, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan. In India, it can be made with chewing
   tobacco or flavored with an endless array of ingredients like
   chocolate, mango, cola, or pineapple. A fiery version called “flaming
   paan” even went viral on social media. It’s literally a fire ball that
   explodes with flavor on your taste buds.

   As colorful and interesting as paan is, it isn’t without its
   controversies. It acts like a caffeine-like stimulant and is known to
   be addictive. It can cause tooth and gum decay and the consumption of
   areca nut has been linked to certain cancers. On top of that, it’s
   unsightly.

   Chewing paan turns your saliva red which can be an eyesore when spat
   out onto public sidewalks. To combat this, the government has taken
   measures to ban or limit the sale of paan, and to issue fines for
   spitting out paan juice in public.

POPULAR CITIES FOR STREET FOOD IN INDIA

   Street food is popular all throughout India but some cities are better
   known for it than others. Listed below are five of the most popular
   cities for street food in India.

1. Delhi

   It’s no surprise that Delhi tops this list considering that it may
   indeed be the city that first popularized street food in India. Just
   spend a day exploring the labyrinthine alleyways of Chandni Chowk and
   you’ll be mesmerized by its dizzying array of street food!

   I went on a street food tour in Old Delhi and got to experience some of
   the city’s tastiest examples of jalebi, pani puri, paratha, kachori,
   kulfi, and more. Delhi has a reputation for having some of the best
   food in India and its street food is no exception.

2. Kolkata

   Like Delhi, Kolkata is often cited for being one of the best cities for
   street food in India. It’s the birthplace of the kathi roll and home to
   many delicious street food dishes like jhalmuri, puchkas, Mughlai
   parathas, and the Kolkata fish fry.

   I went on a food tour in Kolkata and got to experience a plethora of
   street food dishes along with other tasty examples of Bengali cuisine.
   My guide even took me to a few heritage stalls that have been open for
   well over a hundred years!

3. Mumbai

   Mumbai was my favorite city in India and much of that has to do with
   the food. Surrounded by the Arabian Sea, it’s home to fantastic seafood
   dishes like garlic butter crab and Bombay duck, not to mention a wealth
   of tasty street foods like vada pav, pav bhaji, bhel puri, aloo tikki,
   dosas, and the Bombay sandwich.

4. Lucknow

   Lucknow is one of the best cities in India to visit for non-vegetarian
   food. It’s known for its Nawabi and Awadhi dishes, none more beloved
   perhaps than the tunde ke kabab, which is a type of kebab made with
   finely minced buffalo meat. Other popular street foods in Lucknow
   include chaat, aloo tikki, lassi, and kulfi.

5. Indore

   Indore is often called the food capital of central India, and with good
   reason. It’s famous for its Indori poha with jalebi and other tasty
   street food dishes like dahi vadas, bhutte ka kees, khatta samosas, and
   kulfi falooda.

FINAL THOUGHTS ON INDIAN STREET FOOD

   30 street food dishes may seem like a lot in many countries but not in
   India. In this vast country where street food is life, this list of 30
   is just the very tip of the iceberg. But I do hope it gives you enough
   to go on and gets you even more excited to experience the street food
   in India.
