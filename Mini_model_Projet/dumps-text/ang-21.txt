Fast Food Culture and Industrialization

   Meena Chetty

   On my latest visit to India this past summer, I noticed at least one
   McDonald’s in every city, a Kentucky Fried Chicken at the airport, and
   most recently, the appearance of Starbucks franchises throughout the
   country. According to Euromonitor International, a compiler of consumer
   food service statistics, there were 339 McDonald’s outlets alone in
   2013 with an expected 150 new McCafé outlets in the years to
   come.<sup>1</sup> Furthermore, throughout my trip, I noticed that many
   packaged foods in India do not provide nutritional information, unlike
   what is required of all products in the U.S.

   Because of weaker food and drug regulations, along with the expansion
   of the fast food industry, India’s population of obese individuals is
   increasing. India is the third most obese country in the world, with
   more than 3% of its population facing obesity according to Obesity
   Foundation India.<sup>2</sup>  This trend is prevalent in multiple
   newly industrialized nations, including Pakistan, South Africa, and
   China. While the rise of the Indian fast food industry is a sign of
   economic growth, it comes with the cost of rising obesity due to the
   lack of adequate health emphasis and education in India.

   Globalization plays a significant role in India’s growth in obesity. Of
   the top ten most popular tourist destinations in India, five are also
   on the list of the country’s most obese regions. The areas on both
   these lists see some of the greatest economic advancement due to
   urbanization.<sup>3</sup>  Because of the country’s decreasing age
   profile and growing middle class income, a more experimental nature and
   interest in the “foreign” is prevalent in cities. As a result, interest
   in American fast food is peaking. In the past year, Burger King
   partnered with Everstone, a major Indian real-estate company, to expand
   the number of outlets throughout the country.<sup>4</sup>

   The foreign fast food influence in India is a direct contributor of
   increasing health issues as a result of the country’s historically weak
   emphasis on health maintenance. Until recently, public health education
   in India was only available through medical school, reflecting the
   inherent lack of focus on health studies for the public.<sup>5</sup>
   Verifying the state of physical fitness in India, a 2012 study
   conducted by the Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism found
   that 59.3 percent of women and 58.5 percent of men lead sedentary
   lifestyles, verifying the poor state of physical fitness in India.
   Inactive lifestyles coupled with limited health studies compared to
   other countries create a weak foundation to counter fast food
   culture.<sup>6</sup>

   The countering prevalence of malnutrition in India makes matters more
   complicated. The International Food Policy Research Institute has a
   branch called Partnerships and Opportunities to Strengthen and
   Harmonize Actions for Nutrition in India (POSHAN) that hosts an annual
   Together for Nutrition conference focusing on food based health
   tactics. However, one in three of the world’s malnourished children are
   from India; as a result, most of POSHAN’s work is centered on
   alleviating starvation and improving food access for mothers and
   children. Consequently, the organizations that would normally dedicate
   time and resources to promote physical activity are instead focused on
   eliminating malnutrition.<sup>7</sup>

   Because the fast food industry is largely based in America, the
   globalization of our franchises is our responsibility. The fact that
   these companies are contributing significantly to worsening health
   conditions in foreign countries with limited access to health awareness
   should be a trigger for the U.S. to become involved and counteract the
   negative influence that our businesses are having on international
   obesity by helping improve the health emphasis in countries that do not
   have adequate resources to independently do so. The next time I visit
   India, I hope to have access to the nutritional information of the food
   I eat.
