   generation scion running the store, Makhan Lal Das & Sons

   Inside the bustling Natun Bazar neighbourhood of North Kolkata, we walk
   through narrow, muddy lanes, lined with small shops and homes, stray
   goats, and children playing, to Makhan Lal Das & Sons. The
   factory-cum-shop has been in the business of selling sweetmeats since
   1830, and its nondescript appearance is no indication of its lineage.
   Shib Nath Das is the ninth generation of a family that came from
   Debrajhat village in the Purba Bardhaman district of West Bengal to
   first sell sweets in the local haat, or market; he sits on a wooden
   platform, supervising the sweets that are being made to order.
   Thickened milk is made into chena (cottage cheese) and then into
   sandesh (sweets), sometimes with nolen gur (palm jaggery), sometimes
   chocolate, and sometimes a dash of saffron. Two large plates in front
   of Das contain the samples of the day, with fanciful names like ‘Mono
   Hara’ (one who steals your heart) and ‘Abar Khabo’ (I will eat again).
   Wooden moulds in different shapes and sizes lie on another board, where
   an artisan makes conch shell-shaped sweets. Small clay cups of creamy
   mango curd and different varieties of sandesh are offered to us.
   Mishti, or sweetmeats, is an integral part of Kolkata’s cuisine. Many
   attribute the beginnings of the sweet industry to the Portuguese who
   introduced cottage cheese to the region in the 16th century. Others
   claim that in those days, the milkman would often be left with unsold
   milk at the end of the day that would then go sour, and, therefore,
   chena was made (by curdling the milk) and mixed with sugar to make it
   more palatable.

   Kolkata is a veritable melting pot, with the British, Portuguese,
   Chinese, Armenians and Jews making it their home when the city became
   the hub of the East India Company in the mid-18th century. Its culinary
   heritage is a product of all these cultures and communities, which I am
   in the process of discovering while on a culinary trail curated by
   Novotel Hotels and Residences, and Indrajit Lahiri, a food blogger. By
   sampling some quintessential items from the city’s diverse foodscape,
   we get a peep into the culinary history of more than 300 years in the
   course of a few days. The Neighbours from Next Door
   Kolkata was home to India’s largest Chinatown, with the Chinese coming
   to the city in the late 18th century to set up sugar mills in a
   neighbourhood called Achipur, on the invitation of the British. We walk
   through the narrow lanes of Tiretti Bazar, which is one of the two
   Chinatowns (the other being in Tangra) where every morning prawn baos
   and dumplings are served for breakfast from the sidewalks. Large stacks
   of aluminum steamers are set up on makeshift tables: There’s
   siumai—Cantonese pork and shrimp dumplings—fish ball soup, and even
   Chinese bread shaped like churros. One vendor sells Chinese sauces,
   spices and noodles. It’s a communal atmosphere, with people sitting on
   plastic stools and reading Chinese newspapers, while others chat with
   friends.

   We continue on our Chinese food trail with a visit to Eau Chew, one of
   the oldest family-run Chinese restaurants in Kolkata, which dates back
   to the 1920s. It is located on the first floor of a building in the
   rundown compound of a garage, above a closed petrol pump, and is open
   for only 7 hours a day. Red Formica-covered tables and a no- frills
   ambience, with only a fish tank and framed photographs of the first
   owners for decoration, indicate that this experience is all about the
   food. Joel Huang, who runs the restaurant today with his mother
   Josephine and wife Doren, says his great-grandparents came in the early
   20th century and set up a small tiffin house for Chinese immigrants at
   the same location, although the name Eau Chew, in Mandarin, means
   ‘Europe’ and was intended to attract a European clientele.
   g_126693_3b.funnelsoupateauchew,theoldestchineserestaurantinkolkata_280
   x210.jpg The chimney soup at Eau Chew
   Image: Kalpana Sunder
   Right from chopping vegetables, cooking and billing the customers,
   everything is done by Josephine, Joel and Doren. They follow
   traditional recipes with no improvisations or variations. “Our
   customers know what they like here, and come to find that,” says Joel.
   We have their famous ‘chimney soup’ that is kept hot with glowing
   embers of coal, steamed fish with soy sauce, and hearty ‘Josephine
   noodles’ created for a customer who wanted to eat something off the
   menu and different. The dish comprises noodles topped with gravy,
   vegetables and meat. Many of the old-fashioned Chinese restaurants of
   the city, such as Nanking and Song Hay, have shut over the past few
   decades; Chung Wau in the Burra Bazaaar neighbourhood is one of the
   last of these restaurants that are still in operation, with cabins
   named after Bengali classics. It remains famous for its food, which
   includes roasted chilli pork and other dishes based on authentic
   recipes from Hakka Chinese immigrants. The old has slowly given way to
   the new, with chains like Mainland China serving more popular versions
   of Indian Chinese food. The Anglo-Indian Angle
   To get a taste of the city’s Anglo-Indian food—one of the pillars of
   its diverse culinary heritage, which is  an amalgam of  Portuguese,
   French and British  influences—we go to Scoop, inside the New Empire
   Cinema complex, in the Dharmatala area. It is an ice cream parlour and
   multi-cuisine restaurant owned by Joanna Mantosh, an Anglo Indian, and
   her husband. They have cooked up a special Anglo-Indian meal for us:
   Jungli pulao with chicken curry, yellow rice with coconut milk and
   turmeric, pantaras (deep fried, breaded meat-stuffed pancakes), and
   chicken vindaloo. Anglo Indian food was not an integral part of the
   restaurant scene in Kolkata in the past; it was cooked more at home by
   families, and shared within the community and served in a mess or
   canteen run by the community. In the early 19th century, Kolkata was
   home to a vibrant Jewish community of almost 20,000 people. Today, even
   though the community has dwindled, their beautiful synagogues, such as
   the Magen David and the Beth El in the Burra Bazaar area, survive and
   are manned by Muslim caretakers. Inside the labyrinthine alleys of New
   Market in Dharmatala, lined with shops selling everything from
   Portuguese ‘Bandel cheese’ to garments, furnishings and crockery,
   stands Nahoum, the oldest Jewish bakery in town.
   g_126695_5b.sweetbunsatnahoums_280x210.jpg Sweet buns at Nahoum
   Image: Kalpana Sunder
   Founded by Nahoum Israel, a Baghdadi Jew, in 1902, the shop houses
   vintage teak wood furniture, and glass shelves heaving with fruit and
   plum cakes, rum balls, lemon puffs, cream-filled pineapple pastries and
   fruit buns. The fourth generation of the family continues to own and
   run the bakery and shop, which have now become a precious piece of
   nostalgia in Kolkata’s food fabric. Our next stop is Nizam’s, next to
   New Market on Hogg’s Street. A no-frills restaurant, it is supposed to
   have invented, in the 1930s, one of the quintessential elements of
   Kolkata street food—the kaathi roll. The origins of the iconic roll are
   a bit hazy: Some say it was made for a customer who wanted a non-messy
   on-the-go snack, while others say it was made for finicky British
   clients who did not want to soil their fingers. “It’s a perfect snack
   of carbs and protein: A crisp paratha stuffed with raw onions, kebabs
   roasted on skewers, or chunks of paneer,” says Lahiri.
   g_126699_6.nizamskaatiroll_280x210.jpg Nizam’s kaathi roll
   Image: Kalpana Sunder
   Mughlai food, from which the kaathi roll originates, was introduced in
   Bengal under Mughal emperor Shah Jehan in the 17th century, when
   Burdwan became a revenue collection centre for Bengal. Mughlai parathas
   stuffed with kheema, and biryani were some of the most popular dishes
   at that time, and continue to remain so. Mughlai cuisine was also
   brought in from Awadh by its 10th and last nawab, Wajid Ali Shah in the
   19th century. Many of these dishes also had Turkish and Afghan
   influences, from the spices to cooking methods. Our last stop is
   Flury’s, a stylish tea room
   and confectionary shop that is a Kolkata icon from 1927, started by
   Swiss couple Joseph and Frieda Flury, and now owned by the Apeejay
   Surendra Group, who also own the Park Hotels. Located on Park Street,
   Flury’s was just a tea room to begin with and has since morphed into a
   large confectionary and restaurant famous for its breakfasts of Eggs
   Benedict and beans on toast. On offer are pineapple and chocolate
   pastries and cakes, rum balls, and a variety of confection. Like
   Nahoum’s, Flury’s is an integral part of Kolkata’s foodscape, thronged
   by college students and families for decades.

   In the past couple of decades, Kolkata has adopted to new and
   contemporary trends in food and restaurants, with sweetmeat shops and
   fine dining restaurants both catering to increasing demand. Molecular
   gastronomy and fusion fare are also popular trends. At the same time,
   the Hakka Chinese restaurants of Tangra and Tiretti Bazar, as well as
   the traditional bakeries and kaathi roll joints, continue to have their
   loyal patrons for whom food is still cloaked in nostalgia. In Kolkata,
   the old and the new exist in harmony.
