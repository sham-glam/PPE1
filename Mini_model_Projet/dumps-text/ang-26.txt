As varied as it is delicious, Indian food is a firm favourite the world over
— but don't limit yourself to only curries.

   With each region of the vast country boasting its own specialities,
   India’s culinary offerings are practically endless. For the easiest —
   and tastiest — intro to the vast world of Indian cuisine, look no
   further than the humble street stall. Popularly referred to as
   nukkadwala food, Indian street snacks are affordable, accessible and
   mouthwateringly delicious — they also go pretty darn well with a brew.
   Unsure where to start? Simply follow the locals to the most
   popular stalls. Your tastebuds will thank you.

A BITE-SIZED HISTORY OF INDIAN STREET FOOD

   Contested, colourful and different depending on who you ask,
   practically every Indian street snack has its own fascinating origin
   story. In fact, the history of Indian street treats is as varied as the
   spices used to flavour them. There’s pav bhaji, a bread and curry combo
   said to have originated in the mid-1800s as a midnight dinner for
   Mumbai’s factory workers. Vendors, one story claims, would mash up the
   day’s leftover veggies, add some spices and sell the resulting curry to
   workers heading home from the nightshift. Or there’s the country’s
   favourite sweet, the jalebi, which was brought to India during the
   middle ages by Persian traders, the Hindu name for the treat a
   corruption of the Arabic ‘zalabiya’.

   Diverse and diverging histories aside, street food remains at the heart
   of contemporary Indian life. Street stalls provide sustenance for
   labourers and students who can’t afford to eat in more formal eateries,
   a convenient lunch spot for busy office workers and employment for
   over ten million people who make their living selling food and other
   goods on the street.

EATING ETIQUETTE

   The main rule for eating Indian food — on the street or otherwise — is
   to forget all you’ve been taught about eating with your hands. Here,
   it’s not rude to touch your food; it’s expected. Said to improve
   awareness of taste, eating with your hands is also meant to create a
   connection with your meal that nurtures the mind and spirit as well as
   the body. But eating with your hands isn’t a free pass to throw all
   etiquette out the window. Utensil-free dining in India comes with its
   own set of norms — always wash your paws throughly before and after a
   meal, and most importantly, remember to use only your right hand for
   eating; your left hand shouldn’t make any contact with the food. Also,
   try to be a little delicate about getting those tasty morsels into your
   mouth — you’re expected to push the food in discreetly with your thumb,
   not shove all your fingers in.

A PERFECT COMBINATION

   These savoury and often spicy snacks from India are best washed down
   with a brew — ice cold, of course. Little Creatures Pilsner will quench
   any thirst left from spicy aloo tikki and buttery vada pav, while Hahn
   SuperDry delivers a crisp, dry taste matched well with white meat, an
   ideal mate for a kati roll. And to round it all out, James Squire One
   Fifty Lashes pale ale is the perfect pair for hot, complex flavours.
   Plus with its fruity nose and clean finish, the beer also goes down a
   treat with a little bit of sweet.
