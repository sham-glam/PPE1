Our fast foods and their fast food‚Äã

   April 2002

   With the influx of western fast foods into India, one has a chance to
   compare our fast food with theirs.  And there are many reasons why I
   prefer our fare to theirs

   I ACKNOWLEDGED MYSELF AS A SUCCESSFUL nutritionist only recently, the
   day I received my son‚Äôs first e-mail from his college in the United
   States. Among the first things he says he is missing is his hitherto
   forced intake of fruits and vegetables. Am I pleased! To think that my
   teenager isn‚Äôt excited about pizzas and burgers! That‚Äôs quite an
   achievement for me, especially that now seven months after having been
   on campus he says, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt look at another pizza or burger.‚Äù

   But since his two meals a day are paid for, he is stuck with
   institutional fare. Besides there isn‚Äôt much available on American
   campuses anyway other than more of the same. And since the closest
   supermarket is quite far away getting fresh fruits and edible
   vegetables is quite a problem. Recently over the phone he mentioned
   he‚Äôs eating cake for breakfast and it totally freaked this nutritionist
   mother until I realised he was kidding. But knowing how there is always
   some truth in a joke, I am quite sure that he wasn‚Äôt entirely joking
   either.

   Enough of sounding like a love-sick mother. I mention all this only to
   get to the issue of fast foods. With the influx of western fast foods
   into India one has had a chance to compare our traditional fast foods
   with theirs. And, there are many reasons why I prefer our fare to
   theirs.

   First, the word ‚Äòfast food‚Äô is misleading. Because generally speaking
   even traditional cuisine of society when delivered quickly in
   ready-to-eat style is loosely termed fast food. The actual
   pre-preparation of these foods is not fast at all. Only the
   over-the-counter serving of it is almost instant-aneous. I‚Äôm not
   talking about pre-packaged foods like Maggi noodles, ready mix soups or
   now even ready-mix dal and vegetables. The foods I‚Äôm referring to and
   comparing with western fast foods in this article are of
   the dosa and bhelpuri type which are served in a flash in the many
   formal and informal eateries that line the streets of India‚Äôs towns and
   cities.

   THE COMPARISON I AM MAKING IS ALSO NOT about hygiene because whether
   one eats at a 5-star restaurant, in a small roadside caf√©, at a
   McDonalds or at a hawker‚Äôs roadside stall, one is always at the mercy
   of the cook, waiter and others involved in the service chain. Only in
   your own home can you have control over hygiene factors. Often even the
   eating places that look clean are only superficially so. And let‚Äôs not
   believe that in the West everything is perfect. My son has also
   informed me that it isn‚Äôt just traditional Indian cuisine that he is
   missing but also the clean home kitchen!

   And then of course there is the deeper question of what‚Äôs the benefit
   of all the hygiene in the world if food has been sprayed with
   pesticides and chemical fertilizers used in the soil to increase
   productivity and profitability. Worse still, what use all the washing
   and cleaning when the seeds used to grow the food on our tables are
   genetically modified?

   So all else apart, in terms of nutritional value Indian fast foods ‚Äî be
   it a sandwich on the street, a packet of bhelpuri or a dosa ‚Äî are
   better balanced than western fast foods like the hamburger or pizza and
   the accompanying cola without which washing it down is likely to prove
   difficult. And of course our kulfi beats their softees and other
   chemically processed desserts.

   Take for example the ubiquitous bhelpuri. There aren‚Äôt many who can
   resist this combination which is great as a snack anytime and can be a
   meal if one wants it to be. It‚Äôs base is puffed rice and gram flour
   which are both high value foods. To this is added fresh onion,
   coriander leaves, potato, chilli to taste, whole wheat puris and
   tamarind chutney. So in one serving you have vitamin C from the chilli
   and tamarind, and jaggery in the chutney invested with iron and energy.
   The wheat, rice and gram flour combine to give you protein. In fact all
   food groups are well-combined in this single dish! If a good medium is
   used to fry the flour and puri, even that would be beneficial as fat to
   you. In fact as I‚Äôve always maintained if quality base ingredients, i.e
   right type of salt, sugar, cereal are used, the end result will always
   be a health food i.e a highly nutritious meal which is good for you.

   EVEN THE DOSA OR IDLI, ESPECIALLY IF MADE with par-boiled or unpolished
   rice is a complete meal of known and unknown ingredients. The
   accompaniment of chutney and vegetables makes it wholesome. If only
   restaurants would desist from cost-cutting by using the cheapest
   cooking oil! And if only every company vending refined oil would not
   let every restaurateur believe that theirs is the best cooking medium
   which is ‚Äúgood for health‚Äù.

   The simple vegetable sandwich of the roadside stalls and peanuts (with
   onion, coriander leaves and lemon) or roasted gram, are not only
   delicious indigenous fast foods, but also have nutritional value
   especially if the bread is whole grain. Even if not, it‚Äôs a much better
   bet than hot dogs, pretzels and the like.

   So recently when a friend was praising the hygiene at the local
   MacDonald‚Äôs I wondered which was the lesser of two evils when one is
   compelled to eat out: hygienically prepared junk food that won‚Äôt do you
   any good, or nutritious indigenous fast foods which may be hygienically
   suspect.

   As an Indian with strong intestinal flora, and as a nutritionist I
   always choose the latter. The first choice always  being food prepared
   at home, especially by my own hands. an Our fast foods and their fast
