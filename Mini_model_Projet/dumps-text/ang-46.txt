Learning The History Of Indian Food

   Home » Learning The History Of Indian Food

   India is known for having some of the best food culture in the world.
   The number and range of spices and fresh ingredients used across the
   country has led to an unparalleled diversity of flavors. Throw in the
   seemingly countless ways in which dishes are prepared and composed, and
   you have some of the tastiest dishes on Earth.

   In order to truly appreciate Indian cuisine though, it’s necessary to
   understand how much food varies between regions, and the historical
   processes that led to these differences.

   For those who are merely looking to enjoy delicious food, history might
   not seem to be of the utmost relevance, beyond the basics. When you
   really study a culture, however, you learn just how important the past
   is in defining the flavors of a country that we enjoy today. People who
   are well versed in international studies come to understand that
   history, cultural development, and even religion all play key roles in
   shaping what we see and experience in any given country in the present.
   And this kind of understanding is particularly relevant in India, where
   the differences in how regions have developed have specifically led to
   fascinating variations in culinary tendencies from one place to the
   next.

   Indian cuisine is the result of thousands of years of evolution and
   outside influences from regions like Persia and China. The country’s
   efficient trading networks have long provided access to almost any
   spice in existence, from chilis, to cinnamon, to mustards –– leading
   perhaps most importantly to the creation of different types of masala.
   This variety of spice mixes led in turn to the creation of numerous
   types of stew known as curry. At the same time meanwhile, the disdain
   for alcohol in Indian culture has led over time to the cultivation of
   different types of juices and hot drinks (like the much-celebrated
   chai), which only further enhance the country’s flavor offerings, so to
   speak.

   In these ways, different cultures, religions, and events shaped India’s
   cuisine over time. Inevitably though –– given the vastness of the
   country, the variation in trade networks and resource availability, and
   even the different major religious influences over time –– different
   regions within the country also developed unique flavors and dishes. As
   we alluded to in a prior look at northern cuisine in the country, every
   part of India has its own unique cuisine.

   For a few significant examples, consider the following….

1. Delhi

   Among other things, Delhi is known largely for its different types of
   stuffed flatbread, kababs, and Indian ice cream. All these are Delhi’s
   takes on popular meals, and are drawn from the blend of cultures that
   exist in the city. Street food is the name of the game, ultimately, and
   this also means variety. You’re likely to find foods from different
   regions in Delhi if you look and ask around.

2. Kerala

   The best local cuisine also takes advantage of special, available
   ingredients. Food in Kerala, for example, is mostly vegetarian (with a
   healthy dose of seafood), and also takes advantage of the spice that
   has long been produced in the area –– namely, ginger, cardamom, and
   black paper. There are numerous dishes specific to Kerala, but one
   worth knowing is Arikadaka, a dish made by cooking mussels with rice
   flour in their shell.

3. Punjab

   Punjab cuisine has a strong Central Asian influence (typically
   associated with India’s Muslims rather than its Hindu population). The
   meals are usually rich in butter and whole wheat. That said, this is
   also considered an area of fairly diverse cuisine, and one in which
   you’re more likely to find a sampling of Indian food from different
   regions. One of the most popular dishes though is the Sarson ka saag,
   made of mustard greens, ginger, and garlic, accompanied with makki di
   roti, a type of flatbread from the northern regions of India.

4. Sikkim

   This particular region is influenced by multiple ethnic groups at once,
   though it’s the Nepalese cuisine that largely defines the food scene.
   Meat, rice, milk, and some locally grown vegetables are staple
   ingredients, though there are also some surprising elements to the
   cuisine as compared to most of the rest of India. For instance, the
   Bhutia Buddhists in the area will consume beef (which many Indians do
   not), and alcohol is far more prevalent in Sikkim.

   It wouldn’t be possible to cover the complex history and culture of
   India and how the cuisine has come to be in a single article. To do so
   would require a study of Muslim and Hindu influence, a record of
   conquests, complex studies of trade over centuries, and consideration
   of where ingredients come from. But we hope that this piece has given
   you a sense of the complexity, and an appreciation for how learning a
   place’s history and culture can help you appreciate wonderful food even
   more.
