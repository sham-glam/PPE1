Theme:

     * Fast foods are the foods that are quickly prepared or pre-prepared
       and served at restaurants. Most of these foods contain high sugars
       or high fats or high sodium levels. The consumers of fast foods are
       increasing at a rapid rate.

       consumers will have to face several health issues such as high
       blood pressure, obesity and other lifestyle diseases.
     * The fast-food can also affect our brains and make us crave more
       unhealthy food.
     * Fast foods satisfy hunger but it rarely provides us with enough
       nutrition.
     * Due to the emerging fast-food culture, people are not motivated to
       cook healthy meals, which take plenty of time to prepare.

Reasons for the growth of fast food culture:

     * The pre-prepared foods save a lot of time. In hectic lifestyles,
       saving time is a priority and hence the consumption of fast foods
       is increasing.
     * The easy availability of fast-food restaurants is also increasing
       the consumption of such foods.
     * Advertisements of fast food companies show that consuming their
       food products is a cool thing. Fear of missing out can motivate
       youngsters to consume food products.
     * Increasing income of middle-class people is resulting in the
       availability of disposable income. This is also one of the reasons
       for the emerging fast-food culture.
     * As people are now more aware of the importance of healthy foods,
       fast food chains are coming up with healthy options. But most of
       those products are also unhealthy and contain high fats and sodium.

       food consumption.

       Moreover, healthy food should be much cheaper than fast food.
     * Widespread awareness programs on the ill effects of fast foods
       should be conducted. And it should be made compulsory to provide
       nutritional facts labels.
     * There should be a limit on the number of fast foods restaurants per
       area.
     * Parents and teachers should guide kids and teenagers about the
       effects of consuming fast food and the importance of eating healthy
       food.
