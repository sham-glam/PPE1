Traditional food better than Fast Food

   [This thread wins a special prize for the TOW May 4th -10th]
   Do you think traditional is food better than fast food? How?
   Generally food prepared at home is hygienic and healthy. The results of
   recent food surveys show that people are more addicted to fast food
   than our Indian traditional food items. This is well-known by the
   increasing number of McDonald, KFC fast foods.
   How many of us are interested to eat our traditional food like cereals,
   pulses, whole grains etc. How many parents are giving traditional food
   practice to their children?
   Go back to traditional food and reduce the risk of diseases.

   Agree. Fast food has following problem. Fast food is expensive. Fast
   food has no personal touch and looks and tastes like factory food.
   There is no human connection made in between the fast food. So
   basically we are paying for plastic food and not much getting in terms
   of experience and satisfaction. I wonder why we even eat it or more
   likely choose to eat it because others are eating it out of fashion. We
   also spend the money in excess on such food which we should be saving.
   That is what I personally think about such type of the food.

   Great topic and thread you have posted here. It is a well know fact
   that traditional food are very better than the junk food produced by
   this modern day eatry joints. Fast food is the result of laziness on
   the part of us. The current thread of sickness and disease are as a
   result of these fast foods we now eat. But if we go back to our root
   and eat our traditional foods, sickness and disease like diabetes,
   cholera, cancer to mention a few will never overpower us again.

   Fast food joints helps the lazy who have their 'hands tied' by busyness
   of work culture. They crumble all that is served without a iota of care
   about the hygiene or inputs into preparation. No fast food is prepared
   without preservatives which harm our health. Traditional food however
   are prepared with utmost care and love using good quality inputs to
   care our health. It is in our benefit to turn traditional or else place
   our health in the hand of doctors.

   Most of the fast foods are made by frying and using a lot of oil which
   makes them tasty but they are very harmful for health. Fast foods can
   cause various problems like obesity, constipation and heart problems.
   On the other hand traditional foods are good for health and also
   nutritious. Fast foods are vary high in calories and need some very
   good exercise to digest. So if you eat the fast foods then make sure
   you exercise.

   Mathi Gopal, I always prefers to eat traditional food and that too
   prepared at home. Yes at present days majority of people mainly the
   youngsters are choosing fastfood instead of traditional food. They have
   certain reasons for going towards fastfood but it already proved that
   fastfood is not good for us. People on regular eating of fastfood will
   face obesity and other health related hazards, hence one should avoid
   the habit of regular eating of fastfood instead one can go for it
   rarely. Individuals should always give priority to traditional food.
