   Examples of fast food (left to right, top to bottom): Cheeseburger,
   soft drink, french fries, pizza margherita, hot dog, fried chicken,
   submarine sandwich, and donuts.

   Fast food is a type of mass-produced food designed for commercial
   resale, with a strong priority placed on speed of service. It is a
   commercial term, limited to food sold in a restaurant or store with
   frozen, preheated or precooked ingredients and served in packaging for
   take-out/take-away. Fast food was created as a commercial strategy to
   accommodate large numbers of busy commuters, travelers and wage
   workers. In 2018, the fast food industry was worth an estimated $570
   billion globally.^[1]

   The fastest form of "fast food" consists of pre-cooked meals which
   reduce waiting periods to mere seconds. Other fast food outlets,
   primarily hamburger outlets such as McDonald's, use mass-produced,
   pre-prepared ingredients (bagged buns and condiments, frozen beef
   patties, vegetables which are prewashed, pre-sliced, or both; etc.) and
   cook the meat and french fries fresh, before assembling "to order".

   Fast food restaurants are traditionally distinguished by the
   drive-through. Outlets may be stands or kiosks, which may provide no
   shelter or seating,^[2] or fast food restaurants (also known as quick
   service restaurants).^[3] Franchise operations that are part of
   restaurant chains have standardized foodstuffs shipped to each
   restaurant from central locations.^[4]

   Many fast foods tend to be high in saturated fat, sugar, salt and
   calories.^[5] Fast food has been linked to increased risk of
   cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer, obesity, high cholesterol,
   insulin resistance conditions and depression.^[6]^[7]^[8]^[9]^[10]
   These correlations remain strong even when controlling for confounding
   lifestyle variables, suggesting a strong association between fast food
   consumption and increased risk of disease and early mortality.^[11]

History

   Pulling wheat dough into thin strands to form lamian
   See also: Fast food restaurant § History

   The concept of ready-cooked food for sale is closely connected with
   urban developments. Homes in emerging cities often lacked adequate
   space or proper food preparation accoutrements. Additionally, procuring
   cooking fuel could cost as much as purchased produce. Frying foods in
   vats of searing oil proved as dangerous as it was expensive. Homeowners
   feared that a rogue cooking fire "might easily conflagrate an entire
   neighborhood".^[12] Thus, urbanites were encouraged to purchase
   pre-prepared meats or starches, such as bread or noodles, whenever
   possible. This also ensured that customers with strictly limited time
   (a commuter stopping to procure dinner to bring home to their family,
   for example, or an hourly laborer on a short lunch break) were not
   inconvenienced by waiting for their food to be cooked on-the-spot (as
   is expected from a traditional "sit down" restaurant). In Ancient Rome,
   cities had street stands – a large counter with a receptacle in the
   middle from which food or drink would have been served.^[13] It was
   during post-WWII American economic boom that Americans began to spend
   more and buy more as the economy boomed and a culture of consumerism
   bloomed. As a result of this new desire to have it all, coupled with
   the strides made by women while the men were away, both members of the
   household began to work outside the home. Eating out, which had
   previously been considered a luxury, became a common occurrence, and
   then a necessity. Workers, and working families, needed quick service
   and inexpensive food for both lunch and dinner. The traditional family
   dinner is increasingly being replaced by the consumption of takeaway
   fast food. As a result, the time invested on food preparation is
   getting lower, with an average woman in the United States spending 47
   minutes per day preparing food and the average man spending 19 minutes
   per day in 2013.^[14]

Pre-industrial Old World

   In the cities of Roman antiquity, much of the urban population living
   in insulae, multi-story apartment blocks, depended on food vendors for
   much of their meal; the Forum itself served as a marketplace where
   Romans could purchase baked goods and cured meats.^[15] In the
   mornings, bread soaked in wine was eaten as a quick snack and cooked
   vegetables and stews later in popina, a simple type of eating
   establishment.^[16] In Asia, 12th century Chinese ate fried dough,
   soups and stuffed buns, all of which still exist as contemporary snack
   food.^[17] Their Baghdadi contemporaries supplemented home-cooked meals
   with processed legumes, purchased starches, and even ready-to-eat
   meats.^[18] During the Middle Ages, large towns and major urban areas
   such as London and Paris supported numerous vendors that sold dishes
   such as pies, pasties, flans, waffles, wafers, pancakes and cooked
   meats. As in Roman cities during antiquity, many of these
   establishments catered to those who did not have means to cook their
   own food, particularly single households. Unlike richer town dwellers,
   many often could not afford housing with kitchen facilities and thus
   relied on fast food. Travelers such as pilgrims en route to a holy
   site, were among the customers.^[19]

United Kingdom

   Blue plaque in Oldham, England commemorating the 1860s origins of fish
   and chips and the fast food industry

   In areas with access to coastal or tidal waters, 'fast food' frequently
   included local shellfish or seafood, such as oysters or, as in London,
   eels. Often this seafood was cooked directly on the quay or close
   by.^[20] The development of trawler fishing in the mid-nineteenth
   century led to the development of a British favourite, fish and chips,
   and the first shop in 1860.^[21]
   Fish and chips in a wrapper

   A blue plaque at Oldham's Tommyfield Market marks the origin of the
   fish and chip shop and fast food industries.^[21] As a cheap fast food
   served in a wrapper, fish and chips became a stock meal among the
   Victorian working classes.^[21] By 1910, there were more than 25,000
   fish and chip shops across the UK, and in the 1920s there were more
   than 35,000 shops.^[22] Harry Ramsden's fast food restaurant chain
   opened its first fish and chip shop in Guiseley, West Yorkshire in
   1928. On a single day in 1952, the shop served 10,000 portions of fish
   and chips, earning a place in the Guinness Book of Records.^[23]

   British fast food had considerable regional variation. Sometimes the
   regionality of a dish became part of the culture of its respective
   area, such as the Cornish pasty and deep-fried Mars bar. The content of
   fast food pies has varied, with poultry (such as chickens) or wildfowl
   commonly being used. Since the Second World War, turkey has been used
   more frequently in fast food.^[24] The UK has adopted fast food from
   other cultures as well, such as pizza, doner kebab, and curry. More
   recently, healthier alternatives to conventional fast food have also
   emerged.

   As automobiles became popular and more affordable following World War
   I, drive-in restaurants were introduced. The American company White
   Castle, founded by Billy Ingram and Walter Anderson in Wichita, Kansas
   in 1921, is generally credited with opening the second fast food outlet
   and first hamburger chain, selling hamburgers for five cents each.^[25]
   Walter Anderson had built the first White Castle restaurant in Wichita
   in 1916, introducing the limited menu, high-volume, low-cost,
   high-speed hamburger restaurant.^[26] Among its innovations, the
   company allowed customers to see the food being prepared. White Castle
   was successful from its inception and spawned numerous competitors.

   Franchising was introduced in 1921 by A&W Root Beer, which franchised
   its distinctive syrup. Howard Johnson's first franchised the restaurant
   concept in the mid-1930s, formally standardizing menus, signage and
   advertising.^[26]

   Curb service was introduced in the late 1920s and was mobilized in the
   1940s when carhops strapped on roller skates.^[27]

   The United States has the largest fast food industry in the world, and
   American fast food restaurants are located in over 100 countries.
   Approximately 5.4 million U.S. workers are employed in the areas of
   food preparation and food servicing, including fast food in the US as
   of 2018.^[28] Worries of an obesity epidemic and its related illnesses
   have inspired many local government officials in the United States to
   propose to limit or regulate fast-food restaurants. Yet, US adults are
   unwilling to change their fast food consumption even in the face of
   rising costs and unemployment characterized by the great recession,
   suggesting an inelastic demand.^[29] However, some areas are more
   affected than others. In Los Angeles County, for example, about 45% of
   the restaurants in South Central Los Angeles are fast-food chains or
   restaurants with minimal seating. By comparison, only 16% of those on
   the Westside are such restaurants.^[30]

Working conditions

   The National Employment Law Project wrote in 2013, "according to a
   study by researchers at the University of California-Berkeley, more
   than half (52 percent) of front-line fast-food workers must rely on at
   least one public assistance program to support their families. As a
   result, the fast-food-industry business model of low wages,
   non-existent benefits, and limited work hours costs taxpayers an
   average of nearly $7 billion every year". They claim this funding
   allows these workers to "afford health care, food, and other basic
   necessities".^[31]^[32]

On the go

   See also: Convenience food

   McDonald's first two-lane drive-thru was at the Rock N Roll McDonald's
   in Chicago.

   Fast food outlets are take-away or take-out providers that promise
   quick service. Such fast food outlets often come with a "drive-through"
   service that lets customers order and pick up food from their vehicles.
   Others have indoor or outdoor seating areas where customers can eat
   on-site. The boom in IT services has allowed customers to order food
   from their homes through their smartphone apps in recent times.

   Nearly from its inception, fast food has been designed to be eaten "on
   the go," often does not require traditional cutlery, and is eaten as a
   finger food. Common menu items at fast food outlets include fish and
   chips, sandwiches, pitas, hamburgers, fried chicken, french fries,
   onion rings, chicken nuggets, tacos, pizza, hot dogs, and ice cream,
   though many fast food restaurants offer "slower" foods like chili,
   mashed potatoes, and salads.

  Filling stations

   Convenience stores located within many petrol/gas stations sell
   pre-packaged sandwiches, doughnuts, and hot food. Many gas stations in
   the United States and Europe also sell frozen foods, and have microwave
   ovens on the premises in which to prepare them. Petrol Stations in
   Australia sell foods such as hot pies, sandwiches, and chocolate bars,
   which are easy for a customer to access while on their journey. Petrol
   stations are a place that are often open long hours and are open before
   and after shop trading hours, therefore, it makes it easy to access for
   consumers.

  Street vendors and concessions

   Main article: Street food

   Fastfood restaurant in Eastern Europe: The Pajdaš (in Prekmurje dialect
   Buddy), Murska Sobota Slovenia.

   Traditional street food is available around the world, usually through
   small and independent vendors operating from a cart, table, portable
   grill or motor vehicle. Common examples include Vietnamese rice soup
   vendors, Middle Eastern falafel stands, New York City hot dog carts,
   and taco trucks. Turo-Turo vendors (Tagalog for point point) are a
   feature of Philippine life. Commonly, street vendors provide a colorful
   and varying range of options designed to captivate passers-by and
   attract as much attention as possible quickly.

   Multiple street vendors may specialize in specific types of food;
   typically, they are characteristic of a given cultural or ethnic
   tradition depending on the locale. In some cultures, it is typical for
   street vendors to call out prices, sing or chant sales-pitches, play
   music, or engage in other forms of "street theatrics" to engage
   prospective customers. In some cases, this can garner more attention
   than the food.^[citation needed]

Cuisine

   Fastfood in Ilorin, Kwara

   Modern commercial fast food is often highly processed and prepared in
   an industrial fashion, i.e., on a large scale with standard ingredients
   and standardized cooking and production methods.^[33] It is usually
   rapidly served in cartons or bags or in plastic wrapping, in a fashion
   that minimizes cost. In most fast food operations, menu items are
   generally made from processed ingredients prepared at a central supply
   facility and then shipped to individual outlets where they are
   reheated, cooked (usually by microwave or deep frying) or assembled in
   a short amount of time. This process ensures a consistent level of
   product quality. It is key to being able to deliver the order quickly
   to the customer and eliminate labor and equipment costs in the
   individual stores.

   Because of commercial emphasis on quickness, uniformity and low cost,
   fast food products are often made with ingredients formulated to
   achieve a certain flavor or consistency and to preserve freshness.

  Variants

   Many types of sushi ready to eat

   Chinese takeaways/takeout restaurants are particularly popular in
   Western countries such as the US and UK. They normally offer a wide
   variety of Asian food (not always Chinese), which has normally been
   fried. Most options are some form of noodles, rice, or meat. In some
   cases, the food is presented as a smörgåsbord, sometimes self service.
   The customer chooses the size of the container they wish to buy, and
   then is free to fill it with their choice of food. It is common to
   combine several options in one container, and some outlets charge by
   weight rather than by item. In large cities, these restaurants may
   offer free delivery for purchases over a minimum amount.

   Lamb shish kebab

   Sushi has seen rapidly rising popularity recently in the Western world.
   A form of fast food created in Japan (where bentō is the Japanese
   variety of fast food), sushi is normally cold sticky rice flavored with
   a sweet rice vinegar and served with some topping (often fish), or, as
   in the most popular kind in the West, rolled in nori (dried laver) with
   filling. The filling often includes fish, seafood, chicken or cucumber.

   Pizza is a common fast food category in the United States, with
   nationwide chains including Papa John's, Domino's Pizza, Sbarro and
   Pizza Hut. It trails only the burger industry in supplying children's
   fast food calories.^[34] Menus are more limited and standardized than
   in traditional pizzerias, and pizza delivery is offered.

   Kebab houses are a form of fast food restaurant from the Middle East,
   especially Turkey and Lebanon. Meat is shaven from a rotisserie, and is
   served on a warmed flatbread with salad and a choice of sauce and
   dressing. These doner kebabs or shawarmas are distinct from shish
   kebabs served on sticks. Kebab shops are also found throughout the
   world, especially Europe, New Zealand and Australia but they generally
   are less common in the US.

   Fish and chip shops are a form of fast food popular in the United
   Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. Fish is battered and then deep
   fried, and served with deep-fried potato strips.^[35]

   A box of five chicken wings, served at a Hesburger fast food restaurant
   in Helsinki, Finland

   The Dutch have their own types of fast food. A Dutch fast food meal
   often consists of a portion of french fries (called friet or patat)
   with a sauce and a meat product. The most common sauce to accompany
   french fries is fritessaus. It is a sweet, vinegary and low fat
   mayonnaise substitute, that the Dutch nevertheless still call
   "mayonnaise". When ordering it is very often abbreviated to met
   (literally "with"). Other popular sauces are ketchup or spiced ketchup
   ("curry"), Indonesian style peanut sauce ("satésaus" or "pindasaus") or
   piccalilli. Sometimes the fries are served with combinations of sauces,
   most famously speciaal (special): mayonnaise, with (spiced) ketchup and
   chopped onions; and oorlog (literally "war"): mayonnaise and peanut
   sauce (sometimes also with ketchup and chopped onions). The meat
   product is usually a deep fried snack; this includes the frikandel (a
   deep fried skinless minced meat sausage), and the kroket (deep fried
   meat ragout covered in breadcrumbs).

   Fast-food place in Portugal

   A small restaurant with pasztecik szczeciński in Szczecin, Poland

   In Portugal, there are some varieties of local fast-food and
   restaurants specialized in this type of local cuisine. Some of the most
   popular foods include frango assado (Piri-piri grilled chicken
   previously marinated), francesinha, francesinha poveira, espetada
   (turkey or pork meat on two sticks) and bifanas (pork cutlets in a
   specific sauce served as a sandwich). This type of food is also often
   served with french fries (called batatas fritas), some international
   chains started appearing specialized in some of the typical Portuguese
   fast food such as Nando's.

   An example of a local form of fast food in Poland is pasztecik
   szczeciński, a deep-fried yeast dough stuffed with meat or vegetarian
   filling, typical fast food dish of the city of Szczecin well known in
   many other cities in the country. A dish is on Polish List of
   traditional products. The first bar serving pasztecik szczeciński, Bar
   "Pasztecik" founded in 1969, is located on Wojska Polskiego Avenue 46
   in Szczecin.

   A fixture of East Asian cities is the noodle shop. Flatbread and
   falafel are today ubiquitous in the Middle East. Popular Indian fast
   food dishes include vada pav, panipuri and dahi vada. In the
   French-speaking nations of West Africa, roadside stands in and around
   the larger cities continue to sell—as they have done for generations—a
   range of ready-to-eat, char-grilled meat sticks known locally as
   brochettes (not to be confused with the bread snack of the same name
   found in Europe)

Business

   In the United States, consumers spent $160 billion on fast food in 2012
   (up from $6 billion in 1970).^[36]^[37] In 2013, the US restaurant
   industry had total projected sales of $660.5 billion.^[38] Fast food
   has been losing market share to fast casual dining restaurants, which
   offer more robust and expensive cuisines.^[39] Due to this competition,
   fast food giants have seen dramatic drops in their sales.^[40] While
   overall fast food sales have fallen, the number of Americans who eat in
   these restaurants "once a month or 'a few times a year'" has
   risen.^[40]

   In contrast to the rest of the world, American citizens spend a much
   smaller amount of their income on food — largely due to various
   government subsidies that make fast food cheap and easily
   accessible.^[41] Calorie for calorie, foods sold in fast food
   restaurants, costs less and is more energy-dense, and is made mostly of
   products that the government subsidizes heavily: corn, soy, and
   beef.^[42]

   The Australian fast food market is valued at more than 2.7 billion GPB
   and is composed of 1.4 billion fast food meals. This includes meals
   serviced at 17,000 fast food outlets. The fast food market has
   experienced an average annual growth rate of 6.5 percent, which is the
   most rapidly growing sector of the retail food market.^[43]

   In 2012, fast food restaurants spent roughly US$4.6 billion on
   advertising campaigns, which represented an 8% increase from 2009. In
   the same period of time, McDonald's spent nearly three times as much on
   advertising as all water, milk, and produce advertisers spent
   combined.^[44]

   A study done by researchers from the Geisel School of Medicine at
   Dartmouth College saw results that suggest that when children watch
   more commercial television (and see more advertisements on fast food),
   they are more inclined to ask to visit these subsequent fast food
   restaurants.^[45] Specifically, fast food restaurants have been
   increasing their advertising efforts that target Black and Hispanic
   youth.^[46] A 2021 report from the Rudd Center for Food Policy &
   Obesity indicated that fast-food restaurants spent about $318 million
   on Spanish-language TV channels. The same report found that fast-food
   restaurants spent about $99 million on majority Black viewer TV
   channels. Black youth groups viewed fast-food advertisements about more
   than white youth groups.^[47]

   The Council of Better Business Bureaus started the Children's Food and
   Beverage Advertising Initiative in 2006 which asked fast food companies
   to pledge to "advertise only more healthful products to children" with
   McDonald's and Burger King signing on.^[45] However, despite a slight
   increase in healthful food advertising, the effectiveness of this
   initiative has been disputed by studies that reveal that "children
   couldn't remember or identify healthful foods in the ads, and that 81
   percent of the 99 3 to 7 year olds in that study recalled French fries"
   even though there were no french fries in the advertisement.^[48]

   According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 4.1 million
   U.S. workers are employed in food preparation and serving (including
   fast food) as of 2010.^[28] The BLS's projected job outlook expects
   average growth and excellent opportunity as a result of high turnover.
   However, in April 2011, McDonald's hired approximately 62,000 new
   workers and received a million applications for those positions—an
   acceptance rate of 6.2%.^[49] The median age of workers in the industry
   in 2013 was 28.^[50] Obtaining Human Resource Management diploma or
   diploma in Fast Food Management can help to get a job in major fast
   food restaurants since it is one of the most desired.^[51]

   McDonald's in Russia

   McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Pizza Hut fast food restaurants
   in the United Arab Emirates

   In 2006, the global fast-food market grew by 4.8% and reached a value
   of £102.4 billion and a volume of 80.3 billion transactions.^[52]
   McDonald's alone, has outlets in 126 countries on 6 continents and
   operates over 31,000 restaurants worldwide.^[53]

   One example of McDonald's expansion on a global scale was its
   introduction to the Russian market. In order for the American business
   to succeed it would have to be accepted and integrated into the daily
   lives of natives in Moscow. Thus, the restaurant was strategically
   implemented so that its offerings would align with the distinct and
   established eating habits, also known as the customs around food,
   eating and cooking, of Muscovites. One significant characteristic of
   Russian food culture is the emphasis on knowing about the locality of
   goods that are consumed. Essentially, in order to successfully launch
   this American brand in a foreign country, McDonald's interpreted the
   local interests of consumers in Moscow by promoting the origins of the
   produce used in the restaurant.^[54] On January 31, 1990, McDonald's
   opened a restaurant in Moscow and broke opening-day records for
   customers served. The Moscow restaurant is the busiest in the world.

   The largest McDonald's in the world, with 25,000 feet of play tubes, an
   arcade and play center, is located in Orlando, Florida, United
   States^[55]^[clarification needed]

   There are numerous other fast food restaurants located all over the
   world. Burger King has more than 11,100 restaurants in more than 65
   countries.^[56] KFC is located in 25 countries.^[57] Subway is one of
   the fastest growing franchises in the world with approximately 39,129
   restaurants in 90 countries as of May 2009,^[58] the first non-US
   location opening in December 1984 in Bahrain.^[59] Wienerwald has
   spread from Germany into Asia^[60] and Africa.^[61] Pizza Hut is
   located in 97 countries, with 100 locations in China.^[62] Taco Bell
   has 278 restaurants located in 14 countries besides the United
   States.^[63]

Criticism

   Main article: Criticism of fast food

   Further information: Fast food worker strikes

   Fast-food chains have come under criticism over concerns ranging from
   claimed negative health effects, alleged animal cruelty, cases of
   worker exploitation, and claims of cultural degradation via shifts in
   people's eating patterns away from traditional
   foods.^[64]^[65]^[66]^[67]^[68]^[69]^[70]^[71]^[72]^[73]^[74]^[75]^[76]
   ^[77]

   The intake of fast food is increasing worldwide. A study done in the
   city of Jeddah has shown that current fast-food habits are related to
   the increase of overweight and obesity among adolescents in Saudi
   Arabia.^[78] In 2014, the World Health Organization published a study
   which claims that deregulated food markets are largely to blame for the
   obesity crisis, and suggested tighter regulations to reverse the
   trend.^[79] In the United States, local governments are restricting
   fast food chains by limiting the number of restaurants found in certain
   geographical areas.^[80]

   To combat criticism, fast-food restaurants are starting to offer more
   health-friendly menu items.^[81] In addition to health critics, there
   are suggestions for the fast-food industry to become more eco-friendly.
   The chains have responded by "reducing packaging waste".^[81]

   Although trying to overcome criticism through healthy options on fast
   food menus, Marion Nestle, who serves as the chair of New York
   University's Department of Nutrition and Food Studies, suggests that
   fast-food industries intentionally market unhealthy foods to children
   through advertising options and therefore create customers for
   life.^[82]

   Despite so much popularity, fast foods and fast-food chains have
   adverse impacts not only on the job and social skills, but on the
   health and academic performance of students. Fifty-six percent of
   students consume fast food on a weekly basis.^[83] The researcher who
   wrote Fast Food Nation, Eric Schlosser, highlights this fact, arguing
   that this is not only a financial but also a psychological bait, in
   that the students are lured towards this early employment opportunity
   knowing little that the time spent on this no-skill-learning job is
   wasted.^[84] Two other researchers, Charles Hirschman and Irina
   Voloshin, highlight their dangerous impacts and consequences regarding
   the hiring and firing of teenage school-goers in the fast-food
   industry.^[85] Kelly Brownwell of The Atlantic Times has further
   supported this argument that Burger King and McDonald's adopted another
   dangerous practice for marketing to innocent children.^[86]

   In a research study conducted by Professors Purtell Kelly and Gershoff,
   they found that the students of fifth grades, who ate fast foods as
   compared to the students of the same age after some other social
   factors were controlled.^[clarification needed] Also, the percentage of
   the students having consumed fast food and showed poor grades was
   around 11 percent more than those who used organic foods. They are of
