Fast food the Indian way

   McSpicy & McVeggie

   Almost every time we think about Fast Food, American chain restaurants
   come to mind. Fast food restaurants have been springing up across the
   world for decades now and are an integral part of the culinary scene in
   most countries. In India, the fast food industry has had a hard time
   getting going because most people had their own way of cooking and were
   not ready to change their habits. But nowadays, the industry is growing
   rapidly as more and more people (especially among the youth) become
   passionate about fast food.

   McSpicy & McVeggie

   International chains such as McDonald‚Äôs, have adapted their menu to the
   Indian populace‚Äôs taste  in order to thrive. They spiced their dishes
   up, added more vegetarian options and adapted their prices to the
   population‚Äôs regular cost of living. Certainly, Indians have developed
   a taste for western-style fast food but they have different
   sensitivities so the chains have to  ‚ÄúIndianise‚Äù  themselves.

   Doing so, McDonald‚Äôs took into account that Indians don‚Äôt eat beef or
   pork because of their religion or beliefs, hence the creation of
   special dishes including the McSpicy (a spicy paneer burger), the
   McVeggie (speaks for itself) and Aloo Tikki (North Indian snack).

   That‚Äôs all very well and thoughtful but people might wonder why they
   should eat spiced up versions of western food when they have Indian
   fast food offering Asian dishes. Indeed, reviews of the McSpicy suggest
   that it is not that spicy for the Indian palette.  So what about
   home-grown alternatives?

   Traditionally in India, fast food can be found on the road side and
   most of the outlets in India are independent establishments not chains
   or franchises.

   But still, some chains are quite famous such as Darshini. In the
   mid-80‚Äôs, Darshini was set up in Bangalore City. People have to eat
   while standing and they have to buy a coupon before eating. Today there
   are more than 5,000 Darshinis in Bangalore. There are also food courts
   where small fast food outlets serve many different cuisines under one
   roof.

   So the success of McDonald‚Äôs lies in reproducing their menu everywhere
   in the world. They can create the exact same burger in the UK as in
   India but with Indian dishes, it is different. It is almost impossible
   to recreate the same curry twice ‚Äì even if you follow the same recipe,
   the result won‚Äôt be exactly the same at the end, there are too many
   variables. This might explain why they are not so many chain
   restaurants in India. And long may that continue!
