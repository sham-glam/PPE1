Short History of Street Food. Love for Indian Street Food at Indico

   5 May 2017

   Street food consists of readymade food items that are sold by a vendor
   in markets or open places. They may include the solid food items,
   various drinks or juices. Street food has become a very important
   business nowadays. And people have always admired and loved street food
   and street food markets.
   You walk across the street and you will see many vendors selling the
   food items. These are the delicious, traditional food items. They have
   a unique aroma and flavor attached with them that makes every passer-by
   to stand, and taste it. Moreover, they are readily made within a short
   duration of few minutes. This adds to its specialty of giving a try to
   these food items. According to a report of FAO (Food and Agriculture
   organization) there are around 2.5 million people who tend to eat
   street food daily. That is to say, the number of consumers of ‘street
   food’ is increasing day by day.


History

   Every culture and region has a history that shows the love of people
   for street food. It dates back to the ancient Greece time period. They
   used to serve fried fish as their most common street dish. For people
   of ancient Rome street food was their main source of food. The
   ‘chickpea soup’ was a commonly sold item. China has a similar history.
   During colonial time of America, the vendors used to sell ‘roasted
   oysters and corn’. Oysters remained as a popular street dish due to its
   cheap price and delicious taste till 1910. After that there came a
   little set back to it. New York had a bit different history. The
   government put many restrictions on vendors and then actually
   completely banned this business by 1707. In Africa, many women and
   children get their earnings from selling street meals. Another example,
   during 19th century in Transylvania, vendors used to sell ‘ginger
   bread’ and ‘corn mixed with cream’ on the streets. ‘French fries’
   emerged in Paris as the most selling street meal by 1840. In Thailand,
   initially this business couldn’t gain much popularity. In Japan, street
   food business started 100 years back where it was provided to students
   and laborers.


Advantages of street food

   There are certain advantages of street food that has contributed to its
   popularity worldwide, such as:
   • It is easily available on the streets. Hence you can easily buy them
   without making an extra effort to go to a far place for food
   • The taste is delicious and unique
   • It often includes the traditional food items that you may have a
   problem looking for in big restaurants
   • They are made from traditionally old recipes, preserving the original
   taste of these food items too
   • They are cheaper in price
   • Preparation is in front of customers so one gets good idea of the
   ingredients included in them.


Difference between street food and fast food

   A strong association between street food and fast food is often
   created. But this is entirely wrong. They can only be linked in the
   sense that both are readily available. You don’t have to wait extra
   time for it to get prepared. But there is a huge difference in their
   preparation methods and qualities.
   • Fast food is a processed food. Its preparation includes using lots of
   preservatives and chemical compounds. Fast food companies spend lots of
   money for preserving the texture and flavor of their food items with
   the use of these chemical additives. Whereas the street food is fresh
   and pure, just like homemade food, free from all sorts of
   preservatives.
   • Chefs and vendors prepare the street food in front of the customers.
   So the customer knows the ingredients of the food items. On the other
   hand in fast food, a person is totally oblivion of right ingredients
   • Street food consists of traditional dishes of that area. This is not
   the case with fast food.

   spices admixed with food, giving a unique taste to every food item.
