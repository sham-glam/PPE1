   Changes in portion sizes, energy contents and nutrient profiles of fast
   food over the last 30 years shows how these have led to lifestyle
   diseases.

   Till now, research has revolved around trans-fat, high intake of sugars
   and salt leading to cardiovascular disease, obesity, hypertension, etc.
   However, according to a study, by Boston University and Tufts
   University, comparison between the portion size and calorie intake from
   fast food, between 1986 and 2016, shows a drastic increase in all the
   parameters.

   However, there has been an increase in levels of calcium and iron,
   especially in desserts, according to the study that looked at fast food
   brands like, McDonald’s, Dairy Queen and KFC. On average per decade,
   the daily value of calcium increased by 3.9 per cent in desserts and
   the daily value of iron increased 1.4 per cent.

   Even though this rise could be good for treating anaemia and calcium
   deficiency, “people should not be consuming fast food to get more
   calcium and iron in their diet because of the high calories and sodium
   that come along with it,” Megan McCrory, lead author of the study, was
   quoted as saying in a report.

   The report analysed 1,787 menu items and grouped the items into
   — entrées, sides, and desserts. It notes that while entrées gained an
   average of 30 calories per decade, sides did not increase much in
   calories but became saltier.

   It assumes importance as nearly 36 per cent of adults in the US consume
   fast food. “Between 1986 and 2016, the number of items offered on
   restaurant menus grew a staggering 226 per cent, an average of 22.9
   items per year. Along with the menu expansions, researchers found that
   portion sizes and calories had increased as well,” McCrory was quoted
   as saying.

   Advent of fast food in India

   In India, increase in disposable income has in turn increased the
   frequency of dinning out. Big fast food chains like McDonald’s came to
   India in 1996, and soon other big outlets like Dominos, Pizza Hut, KFC,
   etc, followed suit, according to a study by AIIMS, Bangalore.

   According to another report, Indian fast food market is expected to
   grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18 per cent by 2020 due
   to changing consumer behaviour and demography.

   This indicates that India is sailing in the same boat as US when it
   comes to fast food consumption. The latest findings should be taken as
   a benchmark and, we should work towards cutting down the fast food
   consumption in order to lead a healthy life.
