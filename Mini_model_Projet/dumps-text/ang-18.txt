   The pricing strategy in Mcdonald‚Äôs India is so different from other
   countries. Can a popular American franchise like McDonald‚Äôs really
   serve burgers to a country that‚Äôs pretty much vegetarian?

   Will culture and religion be surmountable challenges for this fast-food
   giant or will they find their costs spiralling out of control as they
   build their business in a totally different market?


   In this article, we will take a close look at how McDonald‚Äôs is
   currently building its franchise in India. Also, we will share with you
   the pricing strategy of McDonald‚Äôs in India.  In addition, we‚Äôll look
   at how the fast-food giant is competing with local traditions, cultural
   differences and existing competition to establish their global
   McDonald‚Äôs brand.

How McDonald‚Äôs Entered India


   Amit Jatia is the man behind the phenomenal growth of McDonald‚Äôs in
   India.


   In 1994, the American fast-food giant first contacted him persuading
   his vegetarian family to invest in the business.


   Amit said that he and his family had to think about it carefully since
   nearly half of Indians are vegetarians. They were only convinced to
   invest when McDonald‚Äôs told them that they are willing to localise.
   They assured them that there would be no pork or beef on the menu.


   McDonald‚Äôs signature product is Big Mac beef burger which is known
   across the world. Considering that India will not serve beef or pork as
   80% of the population revere cows as sacred. They came up with their
   own signature product which is the mutton-based Maharajah Mac as
   opposed to its famous beef-based Big Mac.


   There were challenges in entering the market. Based on McDonald‚Äôs
   survey on the Indian market, they learned that Indians wanted to try
   and taste American fast food, however, it should not be a replacement
   for their food. Therefore, McDonald‚Äôs need to adapt to Indian taste if
   they want to succeed in India. They had to customize their burgers to
   suit Indians‚Äô taste and a hyper price-sensitive market. Another thing
   was that half of its population is vegetarian, a separate menu had to
   be created or served.


   What‚Äôs So Good on the Pricing Strategy of McDonald‚Äôs India? What‚Äôs So
   Good on the Pricing Strategy of McDonald‚Äôs India?


Localisation and Competition against the traditional street vendors


Competition against street vendors


   There is plenty of existing competition in the Indian fast food space.
   McDonald‚Äôs has had to compete with a range of alternatives to maintain
   control of the Indian market. India‚Äôs street food, for example, has
   many forms and varieties, and it‚Äôs very popular amongst Indian people.


   Generally speaking, though, when a fast-food chain gives Indians what
   they want (listed above), they do quite well in India, both in
   financial terms as well as in popularising its quick service culture
   among the population.


   Fast food is very popular in India. What‚Äôs more, India‚Äôs fast food
   industry is growing quickly. It‚Äôs now at 40% per annum, generating over
   Rs. 4800 cores in sales and over Rs. 7000 cores in multinational
   segments.


   There are also unique varieties of fast food in different states of
   India which can be difficult to serve well and are generally much
   cheaper than a McDonald‚Äôs meal. For example, the most authentic cuisine
   is Indian street food and can be bought for a few rupees from portable
   stalls found in the Indian cities and towns.


   Street vendors are a serious competitor to McDonald‚Äôs in India. Street
   vendors offer hot fresh, enticing snacks which many people really enjoy
   and prefer. These street foods are popular mainly because they are
   available at half the price of any restaurant food, including
   McDonald‚Äôs.


   Take-out food, fast food, and snacks are easily available which is
   another factor undermining McDonald‚Äôs convenience offer. It doesn‚Äôt
   take much time to prepare street food either, so vendors present a very
   convenient and tasty eating option.


Localisation


   Amit confessed that McDonald‚Äôs adapting for the uniquely Indian market
   was expensive, however, it has paid off in the long term.


   There was no supply chain for lettuce in India when they were just
   starting. Many people used cabbage instead of lettuce on burgers. So,
   they had to start from the very beginning.


   They introduced a burger called Aloo Tikki Burger for 20 rupees (20p).
   It is made with a cutlet of mashed potatoes, peas and seasoned with
   Indian spices. This is McDonald‚Äôs India version of street food. It was
   a hit ‚Äì with the taste, value and price they introduced to the market.
   It radically changed India‚Äôs industry.


   Says Edward Dixon, chief operating officer of Sannam S4, that provides
   market entry advice and support (for multinationals in India, Brazil
   and China):


   ‚ÄúLocalised menu, delivered with precision quality at a price that
   works. One other trick they have used very effectively [is] an entry
   level ice cream which fuels the ability for consumers who might not
   ordinarily be able to afford to become a customer.‚Äù


   In 2001, they began to localise all the kitchen equipment to make a
   burger. They had to take a burger apart, piece by piece and made every
   component local. Even the furnitures, chillers, freezers and
   refrigeration are made locally. Their global suppliers have worked with
   local businesses in most cases to make that happen.


   Moreover, India demands that McDonald‚Äôs offers vegetable products which
   are 100% vegetarian. They want McDonald‚Äôs to abide by strict food
   preparation requirements and a vegetarian menu. This includes:


     * different food groups to be prepared separately using dedicated
       equipment and utensils
     * cooking oils that are strictly vegetarian oils ‚Äì not animal-based
       oils
     * cheese and sauces that are completely vegetarian and egg-less

Diversified Product Range


   McDonald‚Äôs India has a diversity of product range focusing on
   vegetarian products because most Indians are vegetarian. They
   introduced several products that are spicy and tasty according to
   Indians‚Äô preference since they like spicy foods.


   To accommodate vegetarian customers, they came up with vegetarian
   products like McVeggie burger and McAloo Tikki. They separated the
   vegetarian and non-vegetarian sections, making sure that this is
   maintained throughout the various stages. To build confidence, they
   even take customers on kitchen tours. Hardcore vegetarians do not enter
   places where non-vegetarian food is served.


   Evidently, McDonald‚Äôs India is committed to its customers by developing
   special sauces that only use local spices and chillies. Even the
   mayonnaise and the rest of their sauces are egg-less. McDonald‚Äôs wide
   variety of menu includes McAloo Tikki, Spicy Range, Fillet-O- Fish,
   Chicken McGrill, Chicken Mcnuggets, Veg Pizza McPuff, McVeggie, Wraps,
   Fries, an assortment of Sundaes, Soft Serve and refreshing beverages
   such as Ice Tea & Cold. They strengthened the branded affordability
   mantra by introducing the Happy Price Menu which starts at Rs 25 only.


   McDonald‚Äôs India classified its products into 2 categories to satisfy
   consumers with different price perceptions. These are:


     * branded affordability (BA) ‚Äì products include McAloo Tikki and
       Chicken McGrill burgers that cost Rs20-30.
     * branded core value products (BCV) ‚Äì products include the McVeggie
       and McChicken burgers that cost Rs 50-60


McDonald‚Äôs Pricing Strategy


   McDonald‚Äôs uses the pricing approach, ‚Äòthink global, act local‚Äô. They
   have proven to be affluent at using cost leadership pricing strategy by
   offering meals at low prices.


   Prices were kept low by:
     * employing and training employees that are inexperienced instead of
       trained cooks
     * employing a few trained managers only


   They also use price bundling matched with psychological pricing. For
   price bundling, meals and other product bundles are offered for a
   discount. Such as combo meal, family meal, happy meal, and happy price
   menu. The reason is to improve the total sales of the service and
   product. For psychological pricing, they use prices that appear to be
   more affordable, like $__.99 instead of using the whole dollar amount.
   The strategy is to gain customers and make them buy more products.


   Regardless of the standardization being a characteristic of cost
   savings, execution of McDonald‚Äôs price strategy is localised rather
   than internationalised.

Each country is subjected to a strict process to determine the price for a
specific market. The process below is the basic structure that McDonald‚Äôs
uses to create localised pricing:


     * Selecting the price objective. It depends on its business aims to
       gain market share in cost calculation and global pricing strategy.


     * Determining demand. The determination if the demand for the product
       is significant enough to invest in the venture.


     * Estimating costs. The balance of fixed and/or variable costs vs.
       the expected profits from the business venture.


     * Analysing competitors costs, prices and offers. A local survey,
       business planning and detailed market research conducted. It
       determines if there is still room for another player entering the
       business market.


     * Selecting the pricing method. It includes the list price, the
       discount levels and tactics available to teams, as well as the
       financial options available, etc. The part of the marketing
       strategy that generates revenue. The price must also take into
       consideration the appropriate demand-supply equation.


     * Selecting the final price. The price determined by the pricing team
       that is fair to both the business and the public. For example, the
       team may use value pricing to determine the final invoice price.


   Just like most of the companies‚Äô pricing objectives, McDonald‚Äôs also
   aims to increase market share. Its mission statement highlights its
   pricing policy which says:


‚ÄúBeing in touch with the price of our competitors allows us to price our
products correctly, balancing quality and value.‚Äù


   For example, in 1996, to penetrate the market in New Delhi, McDonald‚Äôs
   set their price by studying a local food chain (Nirula).


   McDonald‚Äôs pricing decision involves analysing of demand, competitor
   pricing, costs, a product‚Äôs life-cycle and balancing quality with
   value.


   Back in September 2009, McDonald‚Äôs reduced its menu prices by almost
   25% specifically for its lunch and dinner. McVeggie and McChicken also
   decreased to Rs. 85 from Rs. 110 and 120 respectively. Lowering prices
   in such times was surprising and did not make sense. However, the
   management in India believed that adjusting its menu prices would help
   customers choose McDonald‚Äôs as a lunch and dining destination as well.


McDonald‚Äôs India‚Äôs Success


   By mid-2000, McDonald‚Äôs got its 50% revenue from vegetable food items.
   They proved that they can survive and become successful in a vegetarian
   country. McDonald‚Äôs was also emulating a three-pronged strategy:
   increase seating capacity to accommodate more customers; open new
   outlets in Mumbai and Delhi; penetrate new cities.


   In 2003, McDonald‚Äôs India became one of McDonald‚Äôs top ten operations
   when it comes to average transactions per day in each outlet. Its
   average transactions per day ‚Äî 1,500.


   The major reasons for McDonald‚Äôs India‚Äôs success:
    1. System ‚Äì they had an effective and efficient system in place that
       exploited the minimum wage labour available; they employed young
       teenagers who are just looking to make some money and get basic job
       skills
    2. Convenience ‚Äì their store is everywhere; found in major shopping
       centres, district, freeway, highway, and at almost every corner
    3. Familiarity ‚Äì the associations with the Golden Arches, the Big M,
       Ronald McDonald, happiness and fun
    4. Menu ‚Äì they have the most diverse menus; it targets all ages from
       kids, middle-aged to grandfathers/mothers


   McDonald‚Äôs understood the problems and opportunities of the Indian
   market well. It adapted to its products and has been successful since.
   Its success shows in its continuous growth in the fast-food market with
   400 branches all over India.

Implications


     * McDonald‚Äôs evolved Indian menus, Indian sensitivities and yet
       remain as globally innovative as ever.


     * At McDonald‚Äôs India, the single mantra driving their vision is
       providing 100% total customer satisfaction. The formula to achieve
       this goal is based on the long-standing commitment to the
       McDonald‚Äôs Promise.


     * Being in touch with the price of their competitors allows
       McDonald‚Äôs India to price the products correctly, balancing quality
       and value.


     * Regardless of the long and established street food tradition in
       India that has also become McDonald‚Äôs competitors, McDonald‚Äôs did
       not back out but instead doubled its efforts to build its position
       and keep on competing and growing each day. They‚Äôve learned to
       adapt and to cater their menu to people‚Äôs local tastes and
       preferences.

Conclusion


     * The fast-food industry in India has evolved with the changing
       lifestyles of the young Indian population. The sheer variety of
       gastronomic preferences across regions ‚Äì hereditary or acquired ‚Äì
       has brought about different modules across the country. It may take
       some time for the local enterprise to mature to the level of
       international players in the field.


     * McDonald‚Äôs implemented successfully its cost leadership marketing
       strategy, its overall objective is to increase market share.


     * Arriving at a pricing decision is large as a result of analysing
       demand, costs, competitor pricing. They also consider metrics such
       as product‚Äôs life-cycle to balance quality with value.


     * Other than the cost of living, certain elements such as
       geographical factors, government regulations, economic climate and
       exchange rate also affect the pricing strategy of McDonald‚Äôs in
       India.
