What Is Street Food?

   Street foods are ready-to-eat foods sold by vendors in public places.
   Not unlike food trucks, street food vendors can be found in a variety
   of locations including markets, fairs, and other special events.
   Convenient and affordable, it exists in many different forms and is
   popular in a variety of different countries and cultures.

What Is Considered Street Food?

   Though many street foods are characterized as fast food, it's important
   to note that they can be found in many different forms. Beyond the fact
   that it is sold by vendors in public places, there isn't one specific
   thing that defines street food. Rather, it can be identified based on a
   variety of different characteristics. These characteristics include:
     * Readiness: In general, street foods can be enjoyed as soon as they
       are purchased. Vendors prepare food for guests and serve it on the
       spot.
     * How it is sold: Street food is typically sold by vendors operating
       a food truck, cart, or stand.
     * Cost: Though prices can vary depending on your location, most
       street foods are relatively inexpensive.
     * Waiting time: In most cases, wait times for street food are
       significantly less than ordering from a restaurant. Many street
       foods are already prepared when they are sold, while others can
       quickly be cooked.

Asian Street Food

   Though it is enjoyed everywhere, street food is particularly popular in
   South and Southeast Asian countries. City streets in countries like
   India, China, Vietnam, and Taiwan are often packed with vendors looking
   to feed hungry customers. No matter where you come from, chances are a
   street food vendor will have something that fits your appetite. Below,
   we’ll investigate popular street foods from a variety of Southeast
   Asian countries.

Indian Street Food

   As the second most populated country in the world, Indian food combines
   various diverse cultures and preferences. These different backgrounds
   and cultures can be observed through their street foods. Below, we’ll
   investigate some of the most popular types of Indian street food:
     * Dabeli: Widely considered a popular snack food in India, dabeli was
       first introduced in the 1960s. It consists of a ladi pav, or bun,
       filled with a seasoned potato filling, chutney, and various
       garnishes including pomegranate or roasted peanuts. The filling can
       be spicy, tangy, or even sweet depending on your preferences.
     * Kati roll: Sometimes spelled kathi roll, this popular street food
       originated in the 1930s and has since become enjoyed by people
       across the globe. The key components of a kati roll are kebabs and
       paratha bread. The kebab can be made from a variety of different
       meats including chicken, beef, or mutton, while paratha bread is a
       popular type of flatbread. Once it has been prepared, the dish is
       wrapped in paper and handed to the customer.
     * Misal: There are two main variants of misal are misal pav and
       puneri misal. Misal pav is known for its spicy flavor and is served
       alongside a pav, which is a type of Indian bread roll. Conversely,
       puneri misal is traditionally thought of as a breakfast food,
       though it can also be enjoyed as a snack later in the day. Misal's
       nutritional value and inexpensive cost contribute toward it's
       popularity.
     * Kachori: Kachori, sometimes spelled as kachauri or kachodi, is
       popular across India and parts of South Asia. This deep-fried
       street food can be prepared using all-purpose or whole wheat flour
       and can be found in several different variations. Some are dipped
       in syrup, others are flavored with peppers and chili powder, and
       some are even prepared with coconut.

Chinese Street Food

   China, which spans over 3.7 million miles, boasts an extensive
   selection of street food. Every morning, city streets come alive with
   commuters, pedestrians, and street food vendors. With many different
   regions and climates, their cuisine reflects a variety of distinct
   flavors and food variations. Some of the most popular Chinese street
   foods include:
     * Jianbing: Often referred to as Chinese crepes, jianbing (pronounced
       JEN-bing) is one of the most popular Chinese breakfasts. Vendors
       can be found in nearly every major city across the country. While
       many people might associate sweet flavors with crepes, jianbing
       offers a significantly different taste. The food can be prepared
       using several different topping combinations, with some of the most
       popular including eggs, scallions, ham, and onions.
     * Jiaozi: Jiaozi is a type of dumpling which is typically enjoyed in
       China and other nearby countries. Though the dish is most
       synonymous with Chinese New Year, many people continue to enjoy it
       year-round. They are often filled with some combination of ground
       meat and vegetables and are sometimes served alongside sesame oil
       dip or black vinegar.
     * Baozi: Also known as Chinese bread buns, baozi is available in two
       different variations: big buns and small buns. The big bun variety
       is typically served in street food settings, while the small bun
       variety is more common to find served in restaurants. Baozi is
       typically filled with meat or vegetables and can be enjoyed
       alongside vinegar, soy sauce, and other various dips.
     * Chuan: Sometimes spelled as Chuan’r, this popular Chinese dish is
       similar to a kebab. It consists of pieces of meat that are placed
       on a skewer and roasted over a fire, though they can also be
       deep-fried in some cases. The most popular types of meat used for
       chuan are lamb, chicken, and pork. It’s important to note that this
       dish originates from Chinese-Islamic cuisine and is particularly
       popular with the Uyghur people.

Vietnamese Street Food

   Vietnam offers a large selection of unique, flavorful, and affordable
   foods. These foods are perfectly exemplified through their street
   foods, which combine a long list of recognizable dishes with an
   assortment of under-the-radar options. Though street food can be found
   in many different places across Vietnam, it is perhaps most popular in
   open-air markets. These markets allow vendors, artisans, and more to
   sell to the community. Some of the most popular options include:
     * Pho: Considered the national dish of Vietnam, pho is a type of soup
       dish prepared with rice noodles, meat, and broth. It is typically
       prepared with beef, but can sometimes be made with chicken. There
       are two different variations of pho in Vietnam: the Hanoi
       variation, also known as the northern variation, and the Saigon
       variation, also known as the southern variation. The key
       distinction between these two variations is the size of their
       noodles and the mix of herbs used to prepare them.
     * Bun cha: Bun cha is a type of grilled Vietnamese meatball. It is
       made from pork and is often served alongside vermicelli noodles or
       rice. Other common bun cha mix-ins include pickled vegetables,
       fresh herbs, and crushed garlic or chili. The dish is also served
       with a lime dipping sauce.
     * Xoi: Able to be served at breakfast, lunch, or dinner, xoi is a
       versatile street food that can be prepared in a variety of
       different ways. The dish consists of a bowl of rice which is mixed
       with various add-ins to create a delicious snack. Some of the most
       popular variations of xoi include xoi xeo, which consists of yellow
       rice topped with fried onion and mung beans, xoi ga, which is
       topped with steamed pieces of chicken, and xoi dua, which is
       prepared with sugar and sesame seeds.
     * Cao lau: Cao lau is a type of Vietnamese noodle bowl that is most
       popular in the country’s Quang Nam province. The traditional
       ingredients required to prepare cao lau are rice noodles, meat,
       vegetables, and herbs. It’s important to note that in most cases,
       the rice has been soaked in lye water, giving it a unique texture
       and color.

Taiwanese Street Food

   Taiwanese street food is influenced by a variety of different cuisines.
   Often found in night markets, street food in Taiwan reflects Taiwanese
   culture. Night markets, which can often span over large areas, offer a
   large selection of foods for visitors to choose from and have grown to
   become one of the most popular places to visit in the country. To learn
   about some of the most popular Taiwanese street foods, continue reading
   below:
     * Gua bao: Sometimes called pork belly buns, gua bao (pronounced gwa
       bow) is popular across Asia, particularly in Singapore, Japan, and
       Taiwan. It is prepared by placing stewed meat (typically pork) on a
       steamed bun known as lotus bread. Gua bao is often prepared with
       pickled mustard greens and peanuts, though a variety of toppings
       can be added.
     * Mochi: Often thought of as a Japanese dish, mochi is also popular
       in Taiwan. The dish is made from whole rice grains or glutinous
       rice which has been beaten into a type of flexible paste. Due to
       its versatility, mochi pairs well with many different ingredients
       and is available in several different variations. For example, in
       Taiwan it is common to serve mochi topped with peanuts or sesame
       seeds, while in other areas of the world it is prepared with rice
       grains, miso, or even red beans.
     * Taro balls: Taro balls are a traditional Taiwanese dessert. As the
       name suggests, the key ingredient in taro balls is taro, a tropical
       plant that grows in Southeast Asia and the surrounding regions.
       Believed to be one of the earliest cultivated plants, taro has
       strong roots in Taiwanese culture. Taro balls are made by mixing
       water and sweet potato flower with taro, resulting in a soft and
       versatile dessert. They can be served hot or cold and are often
       accompanied with syrup or served on top of other Taiwanese
       desserts.
     * Dorayaki: Another dessert that is popular in both Japan and Taiwan,
       dorayaki is traditionally prepared by combining red bean filling
       with two sweet pancakes. As is the case with many street foods,
       there isn't one specific set of toppings or mix-ins to go along
       with dorayaki. While some prefer red beans, others choose to fill
       dorayaki with ingredients such as cream, chocolate, and sweet
       potato.

Frequently Asked Questions

   Whether you’re new to street food or are looking to improve your street
   food service, it’s important to stay educated on how to succeed. Below,
   we’ve included answers to some of the most frequently asked questions
   about street food businesses.

What Do I Need to Sell Food on the Street?

   Having the right equipment and supplies for your street food business
   can put you in a position to succeed. Consider buying the following
   items to ensure you run a convenient and functional street food
   business:
     * Food cart: Mobile food carts and kiosks make it easy to organize
       and display your foods while giving you a place to work from.
     * Serving equipment: Depending on what kinds of food you offer,
       serving utensils such as tongs, ladles, and spatulas can help serve
       food efficiently.
     * Disposables: Providing your customers with disposables like forks,
       straws, and paper plates can make it easier to enjoy food on the
       go.
     * POS equipment: Having point of sale equipment such as a card reader
       or cash drawer on hand allows you to collect payments conveniently.

How to Get a Permit to Sell Food on the Street?

   Similar to a food truck, street food vendors must obtain the proper
   permits and licenses to legally carry out their business. Before
   applying for a permit, be sure to contact your local government, as the
   necessities for acquiring a permit can vary depending on where you
   live. In most states, you are required to have a kitchen facility to
   prepare food and act as your primary address. You’ll also need to
   arrange a health inspection for the facility to verify it is up to
   local and state regulations. Once this has been completed, you can
   complete an application for a license. It’s important to note that in
   most cases you’ll need to pay an application or license fee.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Street food can be found across the globe and is a significant part of
   many different cultures. Accessible and affordable, these foods allow
