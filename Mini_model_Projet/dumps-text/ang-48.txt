   [tddrpmenu.jpg]  by Tarla Dalal [tddrpmenu.jpg]
   Recipe Image
   Mumbai roadside pani puri | homemade pani puri | puchka | golgappa |
   with amazing 50 images One of the most loved, very famous and tempting
   Mumbai street food that no one can resist to eat “pani puri”. Who
   doesn’t love Mumbai roadside pani puri? From kids to elderly people
   everyone loves eating the mouthwatering puchka. Pani translates to
   water and puri are puffed crispy dough balls which are hallow. The
   puri’s are made in different shapes and sizes across India. It is
   extremely famous in cosmopolitan cities like Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata.
   Pani Puri, have it spicy sweet or balanced – just the way you like it!
   it is a delight to watch the vendor skilfully punch a tiny hole in each
   puri thereafter adding the fillings and dipping it in the meetha
   chutney and teekha pani. Because of the hygiene and cleanliness issue,
   many people prefer making pani puri at home from scratch. The elements
   required for making homemade golgappa are - crispy puri, a stuffing of
   your choice (soaked boondi, boiled potatoes, chickpeas and moong or
   ragda) and pani (teekha phudina pani and sweet imli pani). There are
   many other versions of pani too like lehsun ka pani, jaljeera, hing
   jeera pani.The recipe can be modified as per your preference. If you
   are making a mixed sprouts stuffing for pani puri then you would
   require some pre-preparation of 2 days. For our homemade pani puri, we
   have made everything at home from the scratch. We have started with
   making the puri first. To make super-crisp and perfect Puri for Pani
   Puri, right at home. The semolina and plain flour dough is made with
   chilled soda, which makes the small puris to puff up while frying. The
   amount of soda needed to make the dough will differ, depending on the
   quality of the semolina and flour, so be mindful when mixing. You will
   really relish the crisp texture of these puris. Once the dough is
   kneaded, divide it into equal portions, roll into a thin chapatti. Cut
   into circles using a cookie cutter and deep fry till they puff up. To
   make golgappa, we have first made the teekha phudina pani, combine mint
   leaves (phudina), chopped coriander (dhania), lemon juice, green
   chillies, ginger (adrak), 2 whole black peppercorns (kalimirch), black
   salt (sanchal) and cumin seeds (jeera) powder in a mixer jar and blend
   it into a paste. Transfer the paste to a deep bowl and add 3 cups of
   chilled water, mix well and our teekha phudina pani is ready. You can
   keep it in the refrigerator and take it out when serving. Further we
   have prepared mixed sprouts mixture for pani puri. Combine parboiled
   mixed sprouts, boondi (soaked for 10 minutes and drained), mashed
   potatoes, coriander-cumin seeds (dhania-jeera) powder, chilli powder
   and black salt (sanchal). Mix everything well. Our mixture is ready!!
   You can also use ragda as the filling. To serve this mouthwatering
   snack pani puri you need to rack a small hole in the centre of each of
   the 6 puris and stuff each puri with a little mixed sprouts mixture.
   Top it with a little meetha chutney and dip the entire puri in the
   teekha phudina pani. Serve homemade pani puri immediately. Make sure,
   you assemble Mumbai roadside pani puri only when you are eating it or
   else it will get soggy and the crispiness of the puri will be lost.
   Here’s a tip for the teekha phudina pani - if you have time in hand you
   can use room temperature water and refrigerate it for 3 to 4 hours.
   Chilling the pani for 3 to 4 hours enhances the flavours. Once you are
   done don’t forget to have a free sip of teekha pani and a sukha puri to
   bring the delightful experience to a fitting end! Also try out other
   popular Mumbai street food snacks like Kaanda Bhajji Pav, Ragda
   Pattice, Pav Bhaji and Jini Dosa. Enjoy Mumbai roadside pani puri |
   homemade pani puri | puchka | golgappa | with step by step detailed

   pakoda recipe | cabbage pakora South Indian style | Indian patta gobhi
   ke pakode | quick snack is a tasty snack to be enjoyed at a family
   get-together. Learn how to make cabbage pakora South Indian style. To
   make cabbage pakoda, combine all the ingredients along with approx. 2
   tbsp of water in a deep bowl and mix well. Drop spoonfuls of the
   mixture into hot oil in a deep non-stick pan and deep-fry a few at a
   time on a medium flame, till they turn golden brown in colour from all
   the sides. Drain on an absorbent paper. Serve immediately with green
   chutney and tomato ketchup. Pakodas don’t always have to be
   onion-based. Here is an irresistibly crunchy and excitingly flavoured
   cabbage pakora South Indian style made with patta gobhi. With a
   flavourful touch of coriander, the cabbage is held together with besan
   to make awesome pakodas. The Indian patta gobhi ke pakode pairs best
   with green chutney or tomato ketchup. You can also serve them hot and
   fresh for parties or as a quick snack, with a cup of steaming tea or
   coffee. If you like Indian patta gobhi ke pakode, then also try other
   pakoras like Khichdi Pakodas, Stuffed Methi Paneer Pakoda, Stuffed
   Spinach Pakoda to make a pakoda platter. Tips for cabbage pakoda. 1.
   Cabbage should be shredded thinly as shown here. 2. Remember to not add
   too much water while mixing the ingredients because cabbage will also
   slowly let out water as you have shredded it thinly. That, along with a
   tablespoon or two of water, is enough to bind the batter. If the batter
   becomes watery, the pakodas won’t be crunchy enough. 3. This mixture
   should be used immediately and not kept for long as it will release
   water and you will find it difficult to make pakodas. 4. Oil should be
   hot and always deep-fry on a medium flame so they cook well. Do not fry
   them over low flame, the cabbage pakoda will absorb too much oil and
   turn soggy. And if you deep-fry on a high flame then they will get
   burnt. Enjoy cabbage pakoda recipe | cabbage pakora South Indian style

   7.  Chole Tikki Chaat
   [tddrpmenu.jpg]  by Tarla Dalal [tddrpmenu.jpg]
   Recipe Image
   chole tikki chaat recipe | aloo tikki chole | Punjabi chole tikki chaat
   | Indian street food chole tikki chaat | with 35 amazing images. chole
   tikki chaat also called aloo tikki chole is a popular Indian street
   food. Here, we show you how to make the potato and peas tikkis for
   Punjabi chole tikki chaat perked up with flavourful nigella seeds and
   spices, and the recipe for chole too. Also pay special attention to
   arranging this preparation, with curd, chutneys and fresh, crispy sev!
   A lip-smacking chaat that is loved all over India, and now globally
   too, the chole tikki chaat is most enjoyed at roadside stalls, but is
   definitely more satisfying when you make it at home for your family or
   for a party. Notes and tips on aloo tikki chole. 1. To make the Chole
   for the Chole Tikki Chaat, we first have to soak the kabuli chana. For
   that, wash the kabuli chana thoroughly under running water. Once
   washed, place them in a deep bowl. Cover them with enough water. We
   have taken approximately ¾ cup of chickpeas as they will double on size
   once they are soaked and cooked. Cover the bowl with a plate and keep
   aside to soak for at least 8 hours or overnight. This is a very
   important step as this not only helps in cooking the chickpeas faster
   but also helps in cooking them evenly. 2. If you want the chickpeas to
   go soft, you can add a pinch of baking soda while pressure cooking so
   that the chickpeas cook properly. But remember you do not want the
   chickpeas to go mushy. 3. Wait for the pressure to drop naturally
   before opening it. If you open it in a haste, the chickpeas will not
   have cooked properly. 4. Make sure that your pan is really hot so that
   you get a nice crust on your tikkis. Learn to make chole tikki chaat

   8.  Mysore Masala Dosa ( Mumbai Roadside Recipe)
   [tddrpmenu.jpg]  by Tarla Dalal [tddrpmenu.jpg]
   Recipe Image
   Mysore masala dosa recipe | Mumbai style roadside Mysore masala dosa |
   Mysore Dosa | with 65 amazing images. This is Mumbai’s own version of
   Mysore masala dosa. While the traditional Mysore masala dosa features
   chutney-smeared dosas with a simple potato masala rolled inside it,
   Mumbai’s street vendors offer a more exotic version, in which crispy
   dosas are smeared with a sweet, spicy and tangy Mysore chutney and
   rolled up with a unique masala of chopped and grated veggies perked up
   with our very own pav bhaji masala. This gives it an absolutely peppy
   and ‘local’ taste, as well as an interesting mouth-feel! Very
   sumptuous, this snack is nothing short of a complete meal, when served
   with hot sambhar and fresh coconut chutney . I would like to suggest 7
   tips to make the perfect Mysore masala dosa. 1. In case if you have
   purchased the dosa batter from the market and you find it thick, then
   add water as required to get a pouring consistency batter. 2. Add some
   sooji (rava) to get crispy brown dosas. 3. Ensure that the Mysore
   chutney is a little thick which will help in easy spreading on the
   dosa. We have used around 1 cup of water for blending. 4. To make the
   Mumbai style roadside Mysore masala dosa, heat a non-stick tava. Grease
   it with ½ tsp of butter. Butter for greasing is used to season the tava
   and form a layer that helps in easy removal of the dosa after cooking.
   This initial greasing is done only once before making the dosas. 5.
   Sprinkle little water on the tava, it should sizzle immediately. If the
   water is not sprinkled, the excess fat will make the spreading of
   Mysore masala dosa very difficult. 6. Wipe the tava using a clean
   muslin cloth or folded tissue. This is to clean and make the tava ready
   for spreading the dosa batter. If there is any fat on the tava, the
   dosa will not spread evenly. 7. Spread the dosa batter in a circular
   motion using a ladle. Our website has a huge collection of over 129
   dosa recipes, glance through these different types of Dosa recipes to
   learn more dosa varieties. Enjoy how to makeMysore masala dosa recipe |

   Indian vegetable momos | Chinese style veg momos | restaurant style
   momos is a steamed snack often served with momos chutney. Learn how to
   make Indian vegetable momos. To make veg momos, first make the dough.
   Combine the plain flour, oil and salt in a deep bowl and knead into a
   semi-soft dough using enough water. Cover the dough with a damp muslin
   cloth or lid and keep aside for 10 minutes. For the stuffing, heat the
   oil in a broad non-stick pan, add the garlic, ginger and green chillies
   and sauté on a medium flame for a few seconds. Add the onions, carrot,
   capsicum and cabbage, mix well and cook on a medium flame for another 2
   to 3 minutes, while stirring occasionally. Add the vinegar, soy sauce,
   salt and pepper, mix well and cook on a medium flame for a few seconds.
   Add the spring onion greens. Keep aside. Then to make Indian vegetable
   momos, divide the dough into 22 equal portions. Roll a portion of the
   dough into a 75 mm. (3”) diameter thin circle using a little plain
   flour for rolling and place 1 tbsp of the prepared filling in the
   centre of the circle. Hold it on your palms, fold the two sides and
   pinch them. Fold the other open side and pinch it again so as to form a
   crescent shape. Steam 6 momos in a greased steamer for 10 to 12 or till
   they are cooked. Repeat steps 2 to 4 to steam the remaining momos.
   Serve immediately with momos chutney and mayonnaise. A snack that has
   become almost synonymous with Chinese cuisine, restaurant style momos
   are made of a plain flour cover filled with sautéed veggies. An apt
   combination of garlic, ginger, green chillies, vinegar and soy sauce
   flavours the vegetable mixture, and the outcome is simply
   tongue-tickling! Traditionally, Chinese style veg momos are steamed in
   bamboo baskets, but you can also cook them in a regular steamer or
   cooker, the way you make dhoklas or idlis. They are a popular street
   food in China and in north east India. You can innovate on this Indian
   vegetable momos by adding other veggies or bean sprouts to the filling,
   but make sure you choose colourful, juicy and crisp veggies to achieve
   the right appearance and to get the mild crunch that makes momos so
   enjoyable! Serve along with Vegetable Chow Mein and Chinese Fried Rice.
   Tips to make veg momos recipe. 1. You can use veggies of your choice
   such as grated paneer or finely chopped French beans. 2. Grease the
   steamer before steaming momos or else it will stick and tear. 3. Do not
   over steam momos otherwise the covering will become chewy. 4. Cover the
   momos with a damp muslin cloth after shaping them to avoid drying. 5.
   Make sure you remove the momos after cooked from the steamer using
   tongs to avoid them from breaking. 6. Do not use too much flour while
   rolling to avoid dry and hard momos. 7. Make sure the dough is semi
   soft as mentioned in the recipe or else the momos will break while
   shaping them. 8. The stuffing should be semi dry or dry to avoid them
   from turning soggy while shaping the momos. 9. Serve immediately or
   else it will turn chewy. Enjoy veg momos recipe | Indian vegetable

   14.  Nylon Khaman Dhokla (gujarati Recipe)
   [tddrpmenu.jpg]  by Tarla Dalal [tddrpmenu.jpg]
   Recipe Image
   nylon khamman dhokla | Gujarati nylon khamman dhokla | instant nylon
   khamman dhokla | with 18 amazing images nylon khamman dhokla is a soft
   and fluffy steamed snack from the Gujarati repertoire. This all-time
   favourite is enjoyed as a starter , as a tea-time snack, or even for
   breakfast. Basically, something you can have any time you are hungry!
   These Gujarati nylon khamman dhokla are so soft and spongy that the
   reference to nylon is really apt! What is more, this recipe is also
   very easy to implement if you follow these simple instructions properly
   and practice it a bit. The addition of fruit salt to the batter, and
   water to the tempering, are the two main factors responsible for the
   super-soft and spongy nature of this dhokla. Temper just before
   serving, for the perfect “100/100”! I would like to give you some
   tips/suggestions to make a perfect nylon khamman dhokla. 1. Add the
   lemon juice and salt to the dough. As this is a sweet and slightly sour
   dhokla, we add lemon juice. Alternately you can add citric acid (nimbu
   ka phool). The lemon juice (or citric acid) and fruit salt create a
   fizzy reaction which results in soft, spongy khaman. 2. Mix well using
   a whisk to get a smooth Nylon Khamman Dhokla batter. The batter will
   have to mixed very well as the sugar needs to dissolve properly. If you
   want you can keep the batter aside for 10-15 minutes till the sugar has
   properly dissolved. 3. Grease 175 mm. (7") diameter thali with a little
   oil. This is an important step because greasing helps the nylon khamman
   dhokla come out of the plate without breaking or sticking. 4. Just
   before steaming, add the fruit salt. This will react with the lemon
   juice to give a fluffy batter. 5. Gently mix the fruit salt in the
   batter till just mixed. Do not over mix the batter, it should be airy
   and fluffy like this! 6. Pour the tempering over the prepared dhoklas
   and spread it evenly. Make sure the dhoklas are warm when you pour the
   tempering or else they will not soak the water in. Serve nylon khamman
   dhokla with green chutney. Enjoy nylon khamman dhokla | Gujarati nylon

   Gujarati households and is also tummy filling, the best part about this

   paneer dosa | paneer chilli dosa | Indian breakfast paneer dosa |
   Mumbai street food | with 28 amazing images. paneer dosa is a popular
   Indian breakfast paneer dosa recipe. You can think of paneer dosa as a
   Chinese counterpart for the popular Masala Dosa, just that the usual
   potato masala is replaced with a fiery paneer chilli stuffing. The
   paneer chilli dosa stuffing has a spicy flavour and a wonderful
   texture, thanks to veggies like capsicum, cabbage, tomatoes, and more.
   It is important to use tomato ketchup in the paneer dosa stuffing
   because it balances the spiciness of the chillies. Notes on paneer
   dosa. 1. Add cabbage. Make use of any vegetables of your choice like
   baby corn, purple cabbage, bell pepper, carrot to give a nice bite to
   the spicy paneer chilly stuffing. 2. Add the paneer. Replace cottage
   cheese with tofu to make it vegan. 3. You can buy readymade paneer from
   a local dairy or supermarket in fresh or frozen form. In case the
   frozen paneer is too hard, submerge it in hot water for 15-20 minutes
   and get a soft texture. 4.To prepare paneer chilly dosa, we are using
   readymade dosa batter. We will add a little salt and adjust the
   consistency by adding a little water, mix well and keep aside. If using
   batter stored in the fridge then bring it to room temperature and then
   make dosa. This is very important or else you won’t get brown crispy
   dosa. You can also try other interesting dosa recipes like the Rava
   Dosa and Neer Dosa. Learn to make paneer dosa | paneer chilli dosa |
