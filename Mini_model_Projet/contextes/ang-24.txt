   immensely. India with rich heritage of foods and recipes had the
   tradition of preparing foods by deep frying in fats. This situation is
   getting complicated by emerging fast food culture in all sections of
   society primarily due to their readily availability, easy to access,
   taste, marketing strategies and cafeteria culture. Therefore it becomes
   imperative to introspect about fast food consumption. There are enough
   scientific evidences in India to substantiate that fast food have
   become integral component of diet in all section of society. High
   consumption of fast food has been reported in school going children and
   this is quite substantial in college and university students - in spite
   of the fact that a significant proportion of population are aware about
   adverse consequences of fast food consumption. Children of pregnant and
   lactating women eating fast foods are more prone to obesity. High fat
   and high sugar diet leads to change in fetal brain reward pathway
   altering food preferences. Fast food consumption is rising in India
   across all income categories and this is contributing significantly to
   rising trend of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in this country.
   Regulation of marketing and nutritional labeling is not up to mark in
   India. Growing menace of fast food consumption needs to be restricted
   by adopting legal, service and education approaches for promoting
   healthy dietary practices.
