   take-out/take-away. Fast food was created as a commercial strategy to
   accommodate large numbers of busy commuters, travelers and wage
   workers. In 2018, the fast food industry was worth an estimated $570
   billion globally.^[1]

   The fastest form of "fast food" consists of pre-cooked meals which
   reduce waiting periods to mere seconds. Other fast food outlets,
   primarily hamburger outlets such as McDonald's, use mass-produced,
   pre-prepared ingredients (bagged buns and condiments, frozen beef

   Fast food restaurants are traditionally distinguished by the
   drive-through. Outlets may be stands or kiosks, which may provide no
   shelter or seating,^[2] or fast food restaurants (also known as quick
   service restaurants).^[3] Franchise operations that are part of
   restaurant chains have standardized foodstuffs shipped to each
   restaurant from central locations.^[4]

   Many fast foods tend to be high in saturated fat, sugar, salt and
   calories.^[5] Fast food has been linked to increased risk of
   cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer, obesity, high cholesterol,
   insulin resistance conditions and depression.^[6]^[7]^[8]^[9]^[10]
   These correlations remain strong even when controlling for confounding
   lifestyle variables, suggesting a strong association between fast food
   consumption and increased risk of disease and early mortality.^[11]

   and inexpensive food for both lunch and dinner. The traditional family
   dinner is increasingly being replaced by the consumption of takeaway
   fast food. As a result, the time invested on food preparation is
   getting lower, with an average woman in the United States spending 47
   minutes per day preparing food and the average man spending 19 minutes

   A blue plaque at Oldham's Tommyfield Market marks the origin of the
   fish and chip shop and fast food industries.^[21] As a cheap fast food
   served in a wrapper, fish and chips became a stock meal among the
   Victorian working classes.^[21] By 1910, there were more than 25,000
   fish and chip shops across the UK, and in the 1920s there were more
   than 35,000 shops.^[22] Harry Ramsden's fast food restaurant chain
   opened its first fish and chip shop in Guiseley, West Yorkshire in
   1928. On a single day in 1952, the shop served 10,000 portions of fish
   and chips, earning a place in the Guinness Book of Records.^[23]

   British fast food had considerable regional variation. Sometimes the
   regionality of a dish became part of the culture of its respective
   area, such as the Cornish pasty and deep-fried Mars bar. The content of
   fast food pies has varied, with poultry (such as chickens) or wildfowl
   commonly being used. Since the Second World War, turkey has been used
   more frequently in fast food.^[24] The UK has adopted fast food from
   other cultures as well, such as pizza, doner kebab, and curry. More
   recently, healthier alternatives to conventional fast food have also
   emerged.

   The United States has the largest fast food industry in the world, and
   American fast food restaurants are located in over 100 countries.
   Approximately 5.4 million U.S. workers are employed in the areas of
   food preparation and food servicing, including fast food in the US as
   of 2018.^[28] Worries of an obesity epidemic and its related illnesses
   have inspired many local government officials in the United States to
   propose to limit or regulate fast-food restaurants. Yet, US adults are
   unwilling to change their fast food consumption even in the face of
   rising costs and unemployment characterized by the great recession,
   suggesting an inelastic demand.^[29] However, some areas are more

   Fast food outlets are take-away or take-out providers that promise
   quick service. Such fast food outlets often come with a "drive-through"
   service that lets customers order and pick up food from their vehicles.
   Others have indoor or outdoor seating areas where customers can eat
--
   from their homes through their smartphone apps in recent times.

   Nearly from its inception, fast food has been designed to be eaten "on
   the go," often does not require traditional cutlery, and is eaten as a
   finger food. Common menu items at fast food outlets include fish and
   chips, sandwiches, pitas, hamburgers, fried chicken, french fries,
   onion rings, chicken nuggets, tacos, pizza, hot dogs, and ice cream,
   though many fast food restaurants offer "slower" foods like chili,
   mashed potatoes, and salads.

   Modern commercial fast food is often highly processed and prepared in
   an industrial fashion, i.e., on a large scale with standard ingredients
   and standardized cooking and production methods.^[33] It is usually

   that minimizes cost. In most fast food operations, menu items are
   generally made from processed ingredients prepared at a central supply
   facility and then shipped to individual outlets where they are

   In the United States, consumers spent $160 billion on fast food in 2012
   (up from $6 billion in 1970).^[36]^[37] In 2013, the US restaurant
   industry had total projected sales of $660.5 billion.^[38] Fast food
   has been losing market share to fast casual dining restaurants, which
   offer more robust and expensive cuisines.^[39] Due to this competition,
   fast food giants have seen dramatic drops in their sales.^[40] While
   overall fast food sales have fallen, the number of Americans who eat in
   these restaurants "once a month or 'a few times a year'" has
   risen.^[40]

   restaurants, costs less and is more energy-dense, and is made mostly of
   products that the government subsidizes heavily: corn, soy, and
   beef.^[42]
