   reason, because there are so many reasons behind the cravings for
   street food throughout the world. To name some:

       sufficient income, people who are bored of eating a home-cooked
       meal, unemployed people, Indian street food comes as a blessing for

       street food is something that fits everyone's pockets.

   difference in culture, diversity in languages spoken, a variety of
   people, and diversity in food as well. Every Indian state, every Indian
   city has its speciality when it comes to street food. Can you roam the
   streets of Indore without having the mouth-watering 'Poha and Jalebi'
   which is the finest street food and speciality of Indore? Can you walk
   through the busy and crowded lanes of Mumbai without grasping a
   'Vadapav'? What about the lip-smacking 'Aloo-tikkis' of Lucknow, Uttar
   Pradesh or the most popular 'Idlis and Vada-Sambhar' of Chennai? You
