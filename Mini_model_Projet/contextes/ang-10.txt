   Street food is ready-to-eat food or drinks sold by a hawker, or vendor,
   in a street or at other public places, such as markets or fairs. It is
   often sold from a portable food booth,^[1] food cart, or food truck and
   is meant for immediate consumption. Some street foods are regional, but
   many have spread beyond their regions of origin. Most street foods are
   classified as both finger food and fast food, and are typically cheaper
   than restaurant meals. The types of street food widely vary between
   regions and cultures in different countries around the world.^[2]
   According to a 2007 study from the Food and Agriculture Organization,
   2.5 billion people eat street food every day.^[3] A majority of
   middle-income consumers^[4] rely on the quick access and cheap service
   of street food for daily nutrition and job opportunities, especially in
   developing countries.

   Today, governments and other organizations are increasingly concerned
   with both the socioeconomic importance of street food, and with its
   associated risks. These risks include food safety, sanitation issues,
   illegal use of public or private areas, social problems and traffic

   The presence of street food vendors in New York City throughout much of
   its history, such as these circa 1906, are credited with helping
   support the city's rapid growth.

Europe[edit]

   In ancient Greece, small fried fish was a street food,^[5] however, the
   Greek philosopher Theophrastus held the custom of street food in low
   regard.^[6] Evidence of a large number of street food vendors was
   discovered during the excavation of Pompeii.^[7] Street food was widely
   consumed by poor urban residents of ancient Rome whose tenement homes
   did not have ovens or hearths.^[8] Chickpea soup^[9] with bread and
   grain paste^[10] were common meals. In ancient China, street food
   generally catered to the poor, though wealthy residents would send
   servants to buy street food and bring it back for them to eat in their
   homes.^[8]

   meat," including chicken and lamb that had been spit-roasted.^[11] In
   1502, Ottoman Turkey became the first country to legislate and
   standardize street food.^[12]

   In the 19th century, street food vendors in Transylvania sold
   gingerbread nuts, cream mixed with corn, as well as bacon and other
   meat fried on top of ceramic vessels with hot coals inside.^[13] French
   fries, consisting of fried strips of potato, probably originated as a
   street food in Paris in the 1840s.^[14] Street foods in Victorian
   London included tripe, pea soup, pea pods in butter, whelk, prawns and
   jellied eels.^[15]

   During the American Colonial period, "street vendors sold oysters,
   roasted corn ears, fruit, and sweets at low prices to all classes."
   Oysters, in particular, were a cheap and popular street food until
   around 1910 when overfishing and pollution caused prices to rise.^[20]
   Street vendors in New York City faced a lot of opposition. After
   previous restrictions had limited their operating hours, street food
   vendors were completely banned in New York City by 1707.^[21] Many
   women of African descent made their living selling street foods in
--
   fruit, cakes, and nuts in Savannah, to coffee, biscuits, pralines and
   other sweets in New Orleans.^[22] Cracker Jack started as one of many
   street food exhibits at the Columbian Exposition.^[23]

Asia[edit]

   The selling of street food in China stretches back millennia and became
   an integral part of Chinese food culture during the Tang Dynasty.
   Street food continues to play a major role in Chinese cuisine with
   regional street food generating a strong interest in culinary
   tourism.^[24] Because of the Chinese diaspora, Chinese street food has
   had a major influence on other cuisines across Asia and even introduced
   the concept of a street food culture to other countries. The street
   food culture of Southeast Asia was established by coolie workers
   imported from China during the late 19th century.^[25]

   Ramen, originally brought to Japan by Chinese immigrants about 100
   years ago, began as a street food for laborers and students. However,
   it soon became a "national dish" and even acquired regional
   variations.^[26]

   Street food was commonly sold by the ethnic Chinese population of
   Thailand and did not become popular among native Thai people until the
   early 1960s,^[27] when the rapid urban population growth stimulated the
   street food culture, and by the 1970s it had "displaced
   home-cooking."^[28] As a result, many Thai street foods are derived
   from or heavily influenced by Chinese cuisine.^[29] About 76% of urban
   residents in Thailand regularly visit street food vendors. The rise of
   the country's tourism industry has also contributed to the popularity
   of Thai street food. Thailand's 103,000 street food vendors alone
   generated 270 billion baht in revenues in 2017. Suvit Maesincee,
   Minister of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation, expects
   the Thai street food segment to grow by six to seven percent annually
   from 2020 forward.^[30] Multiple studies showed that contamination of
   food that street food vendors sell is at the same level as the
   contamination at restaurants.^[31] An estimated 2% or 160,000 vendors
   provide street food for Bangkok's 8 million people.^[32]

   In Delhi, India, it is said that ugh kings used to visit the kebab
   vendors on the street, which you can still visit to this day. During
   the colonial times, fusion street food was created, which was made with
   British customers in mind.^[33]

   9th century, as well as mentioned in 14th century inscription as a line
   of work. In Indonesia, street food is sold from carts and bicycles.
   During colonial Dutch East Indies period circa 19th century, several
   street food were developed and documented, including satay and dawet
   (cendol) street vendors. The current proliferation of Indonesia's
   vigorous street food culture is contributed by the massive urbanization
   in recent decades that has opened opportunities in food service
   sectors. This took place in the country's rapidly expanding urban

   Street food vending is found all around the world, but varies greatly
   between regions and cultures.^[2]

   Dorling Kindersley describes the street food of Vietnam as being "fresh
   and lighter than many of the cuisines in the area" and "draw[ing]
   heavily on herbs, chile peppers and lime," while street food of
   Thailand is "fiery" and "pungent with shrimp paste and fish
   sauce."^[35] Street food in Thailand offers a varied selection of
   ready-to-eat meals, snacks, fruits and drinks. The capital of Thailand,
   Bangkok, has been listed as one of the best places for street

   Indonesian street food is a diverse mix of local Indonesian, Chinese,
   and Dutch influences.^[38] Indonesian street food is often strongly
   flavored and spicy. Much of the street food in Indonesia is fried, such
   as fritters, nasi goreng and ayam goreng. Bakso (meatball soup), satay

   Indian street food is as diverse as Indian cuisine. Every place has its
   own specialities to offer. Some of the more popular street food dishes
   are vada pav, misal pav, chole bhature, parathas, bhel puri, sev puri,
   gol gappa, aloo tikki, kebabs, tandoori chicken, samosas, kachori,
   idli, pohe, egg bhurji, pav bhaji, pulaw, pakora, lassi, kulfi and
   falooda. In Hindi speaking regions of India, street food is popularly
   known as nukkadwala food ("corner" food). In South India, foods like
   mirchi bajji, punugulu, and mokkajonna (corn roasted on coal) are

   bonda. While some vendors streamline the recipes of popular dishes to
   sell them on the street, several restaurants have taken their
   inspiration from the street food of India.^[40]

   New York City's signature street food is the hot dog, but New York
   street food also includes everything from spicy Middle Eastern falafel
   or Jamaican jerk chicken to Belgian waffles ^[35]

   In Hawaii, the local street food tradition of "plate lunch" (rice,
   macaroni salad, and a portion of meat) was inspired by the bento of the
   Japanese who had been brought to Hawaii as plantation workers.^[43]

   the ways in which family street vendor enterprises are traditionally
   created and run vary in different areas of the world.^[44] Often,
   women's success in the street food market depends on trends of gender
   equality. This is evidenced in Bangladesh, where few women are street
   vendors. However, in Nigeria and Thailand, women dominate the street
   food trade.^[45] Doreen Fernandez says that Filipino cultural attitudes
   towards meals is one "cultural factor operating in the street food
   phenomenon" in the Philippines because eating "food out in the open, in
   the market or street or field" is "not at odds with the meal indoors or
   at home" where "there is no special room for dining".^[13]

   Other cultural phenomena that affect the street food market include the
   cultural implications of eating while walking down the street. In some
   cultures, this is considered to be rude,^[46] such as Japanese^[47] or

   non-vegetarian preparation methods to be made at home.^[49]

   In Tanzania's Dar es Salaam region, street food vendors produce
   economic benefits beyond their families. Because street food vendors
   purchase local fresh foods, urban gardens and small-scale farms in the
   area have expanded.^[50] In the United States, street food vendors are
   credited with supporting New York City's rapid growth by supplying
   meals for the city's merchants and workers.^[51] Proprietors of street

   Since 1984, Folsom Street Fair in San Francisco is home of one of the
   most diverse street food fairs.^[54] In addition to much leather, and
   people in various states of dress and undress, the event features an
   outdoor food court serving a variety of street food. For donations of
   $10 or more, visitors get a $2 discount on each drink purchased at the
   fair. In 2018, the street photographer Michael Rababy documented it in
   his book, Folsom Street Food Court.^[54]^[55]

   Netflix has also featured the street foods of the world through its TV
   series Street Food, with the first volume focusing on Asia, and the
   second on Latin America.^[56]^[57]^[58]

Health and safety[edit]

   As early as the 14th century, government officials oversaw street food
   vendor activities.^[11] With the increasing pace of globalization and
   tourism, the safety of street food has become one of the major concerns
   of public health, and a focus for governments and scientists to raise
   public awareness.^[59]^[60]^[61] However, despite concerns about
   contamination at street food vendors, the incidence of such is low,
   with studies showing rates comparable to restaurants.^[43]

   In Singapore, street food vendors known as "hawkers", over half of
   which were unlicensed, were considered "primarily a nuisance to be
   removed from the streets".^[62] 113 hawker centres were constructed

   In the United Kingdom, the Food Standards Agency has provided
   comprehensive guidance of food safety for the vendors, traders and
   retailers of the street food sector since 2000.^[65] Other effective
   ways of enhancing the safety of street foods include: mystery shopping
   programs, training, rewarding programs to vendors, regulatory governing

   is yet to be fully proven and understood. Due to difficulties in
   tracking cases and the lack of disease-reporting systems, follow-up
   studies proving actual connections between street food consumption and
   food-borne diseases are still very few. Little attention has been
   devoted to consumers and their eating habits, behaviors and awareness.
