<h1>What Is Street Food?</h1>
<p>Street foods are ready-to-eat foods sold by vendors in public places. Not unlike <a href="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/article/458/start-a-food-truck.html" target="_blank"><strong>food trucks</strong></a>, street food vendors can be found in a variety of locations including markets, fairs, and other special events. Convenient and affordable, it exists in many different forms and is popular in a variety of different countries and cultures.</p>
<h2>What Is Considered Street Food?</h2>
<p>Though many street foods are characterized as fast food, it's important to note that they can be found in many different forms. Beyond the fact that it is sold by vendors in public places, there isn't one specific thing that defines street food. Rather, it can be identified based on a variety of different characteristics. These characteristics include:</p>
<ul class="noitalics">
<li style="font-size:13.5pt; padding-bottom:7px; margin:0;"><strong>Readiness:</strong> In general, street foods can be enjoyed as soon as they are purchased. Vendors prepare food for guests and serve it on the spot.</li>
<li style="font-size:13.5pt; padding-bottom:7px; margin:0;"><strong>How it is sold:</strong> Street food is typically sold by vendors operating a <a href="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/blog/3356/mobile-kitchens-compared.html" target="_blank"><strong>food truck, cart, or stand</strong></a>.</li>
<li style="font-size:13.5pt; padding-bottom:7px; margin:0;"><strong>Cost:</strong> Though prices can vary depending on your location, most street foods are relatively inexpensive.</li>
<li style="font-size:13.5pt; padding-bottom:7px; margin:0;"><strong>Waiting time:</strong> In most cases, wait times for street food are significantly less than ordering from a restaurant. Many street foods are already prepared when they are sold, while others can quickly be cooked.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Asian Street Food</h2>
<p>Though it is enjoyed everywhere, street food is particularly popular in <a href="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/asian-restaurant-supplies.html" target="_blank">South and Southeast Asian countries</a>. City streets in countries like India, China, Vietnam, and Taiwan are often packed with vendors looking to feed hungry customers.

These foods are perfectly exemplified through their street foods, which combine a long list of recognizable dishes with an assortment of under-the-radar options. Though street food can be found in many different places across Vietnam, it is perhaps most popular in open-air markets. These markets allow vendors, artisans, and more to sell to the community. Some of the most popular options include:</p>
<ul class="noitalics">
<li style="font-size:13.5pt; padding-bottom:7px; margin:0;"><strong>Pho:</strong> Considered the national dish of Vietnam, <a href="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/blog/3160/pho-vs-ramen.html" target="_blank"><strong>pho</strong></a> is a type of soup dish prepared with <a href="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/blog/3914/types-of-asian-noodles.html" target="_blank"><strong>rice noodles</strong></a>, meat, and broth.

There are two different variations of pho in Vietnam: the Hanoi variation, also known as the northern variation, and the Saigon variation, also known as the southern variation.

<li style="font-size:13.5pt; padding-bottom:7px; margin:0;"><strong>Bun cha:</strong> Bun cha is a type of grilled Vietnamese meatball. It is made from pork and is often served alongside vermicelli noodles or rice. Other common bun cha mix-ins include pickled vegetables, fresh herbs, and crushed garlic or chili.

Some of the most popular variations of xoi include xoi xeo, which consists of yellow rice topped with fried onion and mung beans, xoi ga, which is topped with steamed pieces of chicken, and xoi dua, which is prepared with sugar and sesame seeds.</li>
<li style="font-size:13.5pt; padding-bottom:7px; margin:0;"><strong>Cao lau:</strong> Cao lau is a type of Vietnamese noodle bowl that is most popular in the country’s Quang Nam province.

</ul>
<h3>Taiwanese Street Food</h3>
<div class="right"><img src="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/uploads/blog/2022/5/japanese-style-pork-buns-with-pork-belly.jpg" alt="Japanese style pork buns with pork belly"></div>
<p>Taiwanese street food is influenced by a variety of different cuisines. Often found in night markets, street food in Taiwan reflects Taiwanese culture. Night markets, which can often span over large areas, offer a large selection of foods for visitors to choose from and have grown to become one of the most popular places to visit in the country. To learn about some of the most popular Taiwanese street foods, continue reading below:</p>
<ul class="noitalics">
<li style="font-size:13.5pt; padding-bottom:7px; margin:0;"><strong>Gua bao:</strong> Sometimes called pork belly buns, gua bao (pronounced gwa bow) is popular across Asia, particularly in Singapore, Japan, and Taiwan. It is prepared by placing stewed meat (typically pork) on a steamed bun known as lotus bread. Gua bao is often prepared with pickled mustard greens and peanuts, though a variety of toppings can be added. </li>
<li style="font-size:13.5pt; padding-bottom:7px; margin:0;"><strong>Mochi:</strong> Often thought of as a Japanese dish, <a href="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/blog/3302/what-is-mochi.html" target="_blank"><strong>mochi</strong></a> is also popular in Taiwan. The dish is made from whole rice grains or glutinous rice which has been beaten into a type of flexible paste. Due to its versatility, mochi pairs well with many different ingredients and is available in several different variations. For example, in Taiwan it is common to serve mochi topped with peanuts or sesame seeds, while in other areas of the world it is prepared with rice grains, miso, or even red beans.</li>
<li style="font-size:13.5pt; padding-bottom:7px; margin:0;"><strong>Taro balls:</strong> Taro balls are a traditional Taiwanese dessert. As the name suggests, the key ingredient in taro balls is taro, a tropical plant that grows in Southeast Asia and the surrounding regions. Believed to be one of the earliest cultivated plants, taro has strong roots in Taiwanese culture. Taro balls are made by mixing water and sweet potato flower with taro, resulting in a soft and versatile dessert. They can be served hot or cold and are often accompanied with syrup or served on top of other Taiwanese desserts.</li>
<li style="font-size:13.5pt; padding-bottom:7px; margin:0;"><strong>Dorayaki:</strong> Another dessert that is popular in both Japan and Taiwan, dorayaki is traditionally prepared by combining red bean filling with two sweet pancakes. As is the case with many street foods, there isn't one specific set of toppings or mix-ins to go along with dorayaki. While some prefer red beans, others choose to fill dorayaki with ingredients such as cream, chocolate, and sweet potato. </li>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>Whether you’re new to street food or are looking to improve your street food service, it’s important to stay educated on how to succeed. Below, we’ve included answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about street food businesses.</p>
<h3>What Do I Need to Sell Food on the Street?</h3>
<p>Having the right equipment and supplies for your street food business can put you in a position to succeed. Consider buying the following items to ensure you run a convenient and functional street food business:</p>
<ul class="noitalics">
<li style="font-size:13.5pt; padding-bottom:7px; margin:0;"><strong>Food cart:</strong> <a href="/13565/vending-carts-vending-kiosks-and-accessories.html" target="_blank"><strong>Mobile food carts and kiosks</strong></a> make it easy to organize and display your foods while giving you a place to work from.</li>
<li style="font-size:13.5pt; padding-bottom:7px; margin:0;"><strong>Serving equipment:</strong> Depending on what kinds of food you offer, <a href="/2969/serving-utensils.html" target="_blank"><strong>serving utensils</strong></a> such as tongs, ladles, and spatulas can help serve food efficiently.</li>
<li style="font-size:13.5pt; padding-bottom:7px; margin:0;"><strong>Disposables:</strong> Providing your customers with <a href="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/restaurant-disposable-supplies.html" target="_blank"><strong>disposables</strong></a> like forks, straws, and paper plates can make it easier to enjoy food on the go.</li>

</ul>
<h3>How to Get a Permit to Sell Food on the Street?</h3>
<p>Similar to a food truck, street food vendors must obtain the proper <a href="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/article/592/food-truck-permits.html" target="_blank"><strong>permits and licenses</strong></a> to legally carry out their business. Before applying for a permit, be sure to contact your local government, as the necessities for acquiring a permit can vary depending on where you live. In most states, you are required to have a kitchen facility to prepare food and act as your primary address. You’ll also need to arrange a health inspection for the facility to verify it is up to local and state regulations. Once this has been completed, you can complete an application for a license. It’s important to note that in most cases you’ll need to pay an application or license fee.</p>
<hr>
